            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THough perhaps there have been ſeveral Junctures ſince 1661. wherein the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Animadverſions (which were then finiſhed) would have been judged more ſeaſonable, yet I muſt profeſs my ſelf in the number of thoſe men who believe nothing of this nature can come out <hi>unſeaſonably,</hi> till either the <hi>Old cauſe</hi> ceaſe to be thought <hi>good,</hi> or elſe the <hi>good old cauſe</hi> ceaſe to be on the Anvile. And who can imagine but that it is ſo ſtill when men ſtill endeavour to ſupport facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parties in oppoſition to the Laws of the Land? Nay have the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to inveigh even againſt the Laws themſelves that were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:51388:3"/>
to ſecure the State for the future, againſt the malignant influences, and the diſturbing pernicious attempts of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> (as well as other Sectarian) Spirits, witneſs that late vile <hi>Letter from a Perſon of Quality to his Friend in the Countrey;</hi> in which <hi>the able, but more daring</hi> Author ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes the Act for regulating Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as <hi>keeping many of the wealthieſt, worthieſt and ſobereſt men out of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy of thoſe places:</hi> The Act which ſettled the Militia, as <hi>eſtabliſhing a ſtanding Army by a Law, and ſwearing us into a Military Government.</hi> (Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as nothing does more juſtify the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a ſtanding Army (of which ſuch a jealouſie is pretended) than the croſs-grain'd ſeditious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of thoſe men who exclaim moſt againſt it.) The Five-mile-<hi>Oxford-</hi> Act, as <hi>impoſing a moſt unlawful
<pb facs="tcp:51388:3"/>

               <hi>even on this ſcore too. [We affirm boldly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that thoſe for whom we plead</hi> (viz. Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians) <hi>muſt needs be good Subjects to a Chriſtian King, and good members of a

Chriſtian Commonwealth.</hi>] The Man I confeſs has an excellent knack at <hi>whitening Aethiopians, and putting Wolves into ſheeps clothing:</hi> But he muſt not be angry if we endeavour (for our own and other mens ſecurity) to ſtrip them of that covering, leſt under the ſpecious diſguiſes of <hi>Religion, Reformation,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> they once more rend and tear us, and make us a prey to <hi>Atheiſm, Confuſion,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny.</hi> It concerns us to have the <hi>Presbyterian vizor</hi> taken off, and theſe <hi>worthy, learned, ſober, ſerious</hi> Gentlemen of the padd expoſed in their proper ſhape and features, that ſo they may be too well known to be ſuffered to <hi>rob us</hi> any more of our Laws, Government, Order, Peace and tranquillity.

<pb facs="tcp:51388:4"/>
of theſe <hi>devouring Sepulchres:</hi> And becauſe this <hi>demure</hi> Author had taken ſo much pains to make them appear beautiful outwardly, I thought it worth mine to pare away the graſs, and to ſet a freſh mark upon them, that ſo honeſt men might not fall into them unawares, nor permit themſelves to be again defiled with Presbyterian uncleanneſs.</p>

            <head>ANIMADVERSIONS on a Book Entitled, <hi>The Intereſt of</hi> ENGLAND <hi>in the matter of</hi> RELIGION.</head>
            <p>THE Author having told us, <hi>Page 16. (26. 2. Edit.</hi>) that <hi>among the various diſagreeing Parties within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, two main ones appear above the reſt, viz. the Epiſcopal, and Presbyterian: and that the diſunion between theſe Parties muſt be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved either by the abolition of one Party, or by the coalition of both into one, or by a toleration indulg'd to the weaker ſide,</hi> he proceeds <hi>p.</hi> 17. (27.) (without ſtaying to inform us how diſunion of Parties may be ſaid to be remov'd either by the abolition, or toleration of one Party) to that which he preſumes the great caſe of the time, and therefore propoſes it as the ſubject of his diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in which of theſe three ways, Abolition, Coalition, or Toleration the true Intereſt of the King and Kingdom lies. And the firſt thing that he enquires into is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51388:6"/>[<hi>Whether in Juſtice or reaſon of State the Presbyterian Party ſhould be rejected and depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or protected and encouraged?</hi>]</p>
            <p>Which Party he diſtinguiſhes from Prelatiſts by theſe Characters (which <hi>p.</hi> 20. (30.) he calls <hi>their main and rooted Principles.) 1. They admire and magnify the holy Scriptures, and take them for the abſolute perfect Rule of Faith and life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſupplement of Eccleſiaſtical Tradition—yet they deny not due reſpect and reverence to venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Antiquity. 2. They aſſert the ſtudy and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures to be the duty and priviledge of all Chriſtians—yet they acknowledge the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a ſtanding Goſpel-miniſtery, and receive the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective Authority of the Church, not with impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Faith, but the Judgment of Diſcretion. 3. They hold the teaching of the Spirit neceſſary to the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt—yet they hold not that the ſpirit brings new Revelations. 4. They exalt divine ordinances, but debaſe humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Gods worſhip, particularly Ceremonies, properly religious, and of inſtituted, myſtical ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification—yet they allow the natural expreſſions of reverence and devotion, as kneeling, and lifting up of the hands and eyes in prayer: as alſo thoſe meer circumſtances of decency and order, the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof would make the ſervice of God either undecent or leſs decent. 5. They rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus having no confidence in a legal righteouſneſs, but deſire to be found in him who is made unto us righteouſneſs by gracious imputation: yet withal they affirm conſtantly that good works of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51388:6"/>
God, and of juſtice and charity towards men are neceſſary to ſalvation. 6. Their Doctrine bears full conformity with that of the Reformed Churches held forth in their publick confeſſions, and particularly with that of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in the 39 Articles; only one or two paſſages per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure excepted ſo far as they may import the aſſerting of Prelacy, and humane myſtical Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. 7. They inſiſt much on the neceſſity of Regeneration, and therein lay the ground-work for the practice of Godlineſs. 8. They preſs upon themſelves and others the ſevere exerciſe not of a Popiſh outſide, formal, but a ſpiritual and real mortification, and ſelf denial according to the power of Chriſtianity. 9. They are ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Lords day, and conſtant in Family-Prayer. 10. They abſtain from Oaths, yea petty Oaths, and the irreverent uſage of Gods name in common diſcourſe. 11. They are ſober, juſt and circumſpect in their whole converſation. Such,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is the temper and conſtitution of this Party, which in its full latitude lies in the middle between thoſe that affect a ceremonial worſhip and the height of Hierarchical Government on the one hand, and thoſe that reject an ordained miniſtery and ſettled Church-Order and regular <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity on the other hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now either the man would have all theſe particularly look'd upon as truly diſcriminating characters of the Presbyterians, from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical party, or he would not; if he would not, to what end does he here mention them? and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51388:7"/>
that as middle Principles in reference to the two extremes, <hi>viz.</hi> Prelatiſts and rejecters of an Ordain'd miniſtery and ſettled Church-order, and regular unity? if he would, with what face, juſtice or honeſty, does he imply that the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts magnify not the holy Scriptures as the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, perfect, rule of Faith and life? that they deny the ſtudy and knowledge of the Scriptures to be the duty and priviledge of all Chriſtians, or the teaching of the Spirit to be neceſſary to the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt? that they exalt not divine ordinances? that they worſhip not God in the ſpirit according to the ſimplicity of Goſpel Inſtitutions? that they affirm not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly good works towards God and men neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, &amp;c. Let him evince if he can, that the Prelatiſts are thus culpable; if he cannot, he deſerves to be reckon'd, not in the number of ſuch Presbyterians as are [juſt and circumſpect in their whole behaviour] but of ſuch as practically deny juſtice and charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men to be neceſſary to ſalvation. And if he can with truth affirm (as I ſuppoſe he may) that the Presbyterian party believe S. <hi>James</hi> his Epiſtle (and the ſecond chapter of it) to be Canonical Scripture, and that (according to his doctrine verſe 10.) he that offends in one point of the Law of liberty is guilty of all, they are little beholding to him for exhibiting ſuch a Character of them to the world, wherein ſo very few of thoſe excellent vertues taught by our Saviour in his Sermon on the mount, and inculcated as Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51388:7"/>
to Chriſtianity and abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, are mentioned as practiſed by that Party.</p>
            <p>I am ſure Prelatiſts have great reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his fraudulent, diſingenuous dealing, in endeavouring to cheat the world with ſuch an imperfect pourtraicture of the Presbyterian party: wherein his behaviour is no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable than his would be who had either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or confidence enough to give this as an adequate deſcription of the Sect of the Phariſees, <hi>viz.</hi> They were perſons that diſdain'd not to hear <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt's Sermons, and to come to his Baptiſm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 5, 7. They gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo to hear Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luk. 5. 17. Mark</hi> 2. 6. They kept him company at Feaſts, as appears from <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 16. and abroad, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 2. One of them invited him to his houſe to Dinner, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 36.

decent.—They affirm works of piety towards God and of charity towards men, to be neceſſary to ſalvation.—I ſay, would this man judge this character of that Society ſo entire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, as that a more full and impartial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphering of them would be needleſs in reference to a right determination of that queſtion? I trow not. Would he not judge this alſo fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> whether they deny that Faith is to be kept with Proteſtants?—Whether they own the Kings Supremacy in all matters, over all perſons, Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, within his own Dominions?

Surely Reaſon of State (if by that be meant State-Policy in order to ſelf-preſervation) will prompt all Kings and Princes diligently and deliberately to enquire and conſider, whether thoſe who would be protected and encouraged by them deſerve to have ſuch a black character affixt upon them or no, and conſequently they might juſtly treat that Writer with ſeverity who ſhould dare to move Kings to protect and encourage ſuch perſons, by giving in a liſt of a few wholſome opinions of theirs, and trecherouſly (or rather traiterouſly) concealing their damnable and pernicious tenents.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51388:9"/>That this mans Character of the Engliſh Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians is of this nature may be evident to any perſon that reflects upon and ſeriouſly conſiders their ſolemn League and Covenant, fram'd and impoſed in the time of the Long Parliament, in the firſt Article whereof they ſwear that <hi>they will ſincerely and conſtantly endeavour in their places and callings the preſervation of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, [in the Church of</hi> Scotland,] <hi>in Doctrine, Worſhip, [Diſcipline and Government.</hi>] Now the Scotch Author or [Ladenſium <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] in his Poſtſcript againſt <hi>Lyſimachus Nicanor,</hi> tells us, p. 35. that <hi>Epiſcopacy is no way ſo oppoſite to the Diſcipline of [any reformed Church] as to that Diſcipline which many Aſſemblies and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments have ſettled in</hi> Scotland: and therefore he concludes thus, <hi>p. 36. 37. [we cannot diſſemble any longer our hearty wiſhes,—that</hi> England <hi>would after the example of all the reformed Churches ridd themſelves at laſt of their Biſhops trouble, as they did of old, without any repentance to this day, of their Abbots and Monks. This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we conceive would much increaſe the joy and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all the three Dominions.</hi> Accordingly thoſe Covenanters ſware alſo to <hi>endeavour the reformation of Religion in the Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government, according to the word of God, and [the example] of the beſt reformed Churches.</hi> Now all the reformed Churches, as the ſame Author affirms, p. 35. caſt out at firſt, and to this day have carefully holden at the door even
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51388:9"/>
that kind of Epiſcopacy which their chief Divines ſeem'd not much to oppoſe. Suitable whereunto is that which Presbyterians ſware in the ſecond Article of the Covenant, <hi>viz. to endeavour the extirpation of Church-Government by Biſhops (as well as by Archbiſhops, Chancellors, Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c.</hi>) With what face therefore can this Author preſume to tell us, p. 19. (29.) that <hi>the Form of Eccleſiaſtical Government by Parochial and Claſſical Presbyteries, Provincial and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Aſſemblies, is remote enough from the main cauſe of Presbytery?</hi> eſpecially ſince he affirms, p. 24. (34.) that <hi>one of his Majeſties Kingdoms</hi> (Scotland) is <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> by which ſure he means not [moderately Epiſcopal:] for p. 59. (69.) that he may prove the Presbyterian Form of Government a. Fence againſt Hereſies and Errors, he inſtances in the Form of Eccleſiaſtical Policy and method of Diſcipline in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which (as there deſcribed) is no otherwiſe than by Parochial and Claſſical Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, Provincial and National Aſſemblies. Now how injurious the Scotch Diſcipline (which Engliſh Presbyterians have thus covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to introduce) is to the civil magiſtrate, how oppreſſive to the ſubject, and pernicious to both, Biſhop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> (ſince Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi>) hath abundantly manifeſted in his [<hi>Fair warning for</hi> England <hi>to take heed of the Scotch Diſcipline;</hi> or as 'tis lately Printed, <hi>of the Presbyterian Government.</hi>] In which treatiſe he endeavours to prove that their Diſcipline doth utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51388:10"/>
the rights of Magiſtrates to convocate Synods, to confirm their Acts, to order Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Affairs, and reform the Church within their Dominions; that it robs the Magiſtrate of the laſt Appeal of his Subjects; that it exempts the Miniſters from due puniſhment; that it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the ſupreme magiſtrate to their Cenſures; that it robs him of his pardoning power (as to ſome crimes) of his civil power in order to Religion; that it makes a monſter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, is moſt prejudicial to the Parliament, is oppreſſive to particular perſons, and hurtful to all orders of men; that the Diſciplinarians challenge this exorbitant power by Divine right. The truth of theſe propoſitions he hath evinc'd out of their Books of Diſcipline, and publick Records of their practice. Since therefore the Engliſh Presbyterians have ſworn to endeavour the preſervation of this Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to reform the Diſcipline and Government here in <hi>England,</hi> according to—the Example of the reformed Church in <hi>Scotland,</hi> 'tis but a piece of juſtice and reaſon that the King's Majeſty ſhould look upon them as perſons owning thoſe ſeditious Principles, upon which ſuch enormous Diſciplinarian practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are grounded. Some of which Principles are theſe: 1. <hi>That their National Aſſemblies ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be retain'd in their own liberties (of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lawfully together, p. 7.) with power to the Kirk to appoint times and places. 2. That they have power to aboliſh and abrogate all Statutes and Ordinances
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51388:10"/>
concerning Eccleſiaſtical matters, that are found noyſome and unprofitable, and agree not with the time, or are abuſed by the people; and to make Rules and Conſtitutions for keeping good order in the Kirk, (p. 8.) 3. That Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline ought to be exerciſed, whether it be ratified by the civil magiſtrate or no, p. 9, 12. 4. That from the Kirk there is no reclamation nor appellation to any judge Civil or Eccleſiaſtical with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm, p. 13. 5. That to their Diſcipline all the Eſtates within the Realm muſt be ſubject, as well Rulers as they who are ruled, p. 16. 6. That the Civil Magiſtrate cannot pardon any crime that was made capital by the judicial Law, p. 12. 7. That matters of the Pulpit ought to be exempted from the judgment and correction of Princes, p. 14. In proportion to which principles, the Kirk p. 5. by their own Authority decreed the abolition of Biſhops, requiring them to reſign their offices (as not having any call from Gods word) under pain of Excommunication, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from preaching till they had a new admiſſion from the general Aſſembly.—They reſolv'd alſo to diſpoſe of their poſſeſſions as the Kings Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the next Aſſembly.—When they could not prevail to have their Book of Diſcipline ratifyed by the Civil Authority, they obtruded it on the Church themſelves, p. 6. ordaining that all thoſe who had born or did then bear any office in the Church ſhould ſubſcribe it under pain of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.—By their own authority alſo, p. 7. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the specious title of Jeſus Chriſt, King of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51388:11"/>
Kings, and Lord of Lords, the only Monarch of this Church, and under pretence of his prerogative Royal they erected their own Courts and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the moſt part of</hi> Scotland, <hi>long before they were legally approv'd or receiv'd.—In their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at</hi> Edenburgh, 1647. <hi>they determined, that nothing ſhould be paſs'd in the next Parliament till the Church was fully reſtored to its Patrimony; yea,</hi> (ſays the Lord Primate <hi>p. 5.) they arrived to that degree of ſaucineſs,</hi> Anno 1600. <hi>and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Soveraign power to ſuch contempt that 20 Presbyters (no more at the higheſt, ſometimes but 13, ſometimes but 7 or 8) dar'd to hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a general Aſſembly (as they miſcalled it) after it was diſcharged by the King, againſt his Authority; an Inſolence which never any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment durſt attempt.</hi> Anno 1582. <hi>they rejected</hi> Mongomery's <hi>appeal from themſelves to King</hi> James, <hi>as made to an incompetent Judge, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded violently againſt him notwithſtanding the Kings prohibition, p.</hi> 13. They who have a mind to ſee more inſtances of the like nature may read that Book of the Archbiſhop.</p>
            <p>Now the Queſtion muſt be, 1. whether thoſe Engliſh Presbyterians who have covenanted to endeavour the Preſervation of the Diſcipline and Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ought not to be look'd upon as perſons approving thoſe Principles and practices upon which that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government is founded and exerciſed? 2. Whether thoſe Engliſh Presbyterians who have covenanted to endeavour the reformation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51388:11"/>
of Religion in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government according to the example of the beſt reformed Churches, in the number of which Churches they may well be ſuppoſed to reckon the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ought not to be look'd upon as perſons engaging themſelves to imitate that Kirk by endeavouring the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the like practices here in <hi>England,</hi> grounded on the like principles? 3. Whether therefore ſuch an approbation of thoſe Principles and Practices ought not in juſtice to have been mentioned as part of their Character? and 4. Whether perſons that may juſtly have ſuch a character affixt upon them, ought in juſtice or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State to be protected and encouraged, or rejected and depreſſed?</p>
            <p>Whereas this Author tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 24. (34.) [that <hi>the men of the Presbyterian perſwaſion are not lukewarm, but true zelots.</hi>] I anſwer, They are ſo much the more dangerous and more likely to be Inſtruments of miſchief, unleſs their zeal be ballaſted with knowledge and diſcretion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted in lawful ways. Indeed if they are like the <hi>Scotch</hi> Diſciplinarian zelots before mentioned, they are ſo far from being lukewarm, that they are rather Seditious Incendiaries, and prone to nothing more than the kindling of devouring Fires in that Nation where they are encourag'd.</p>

               <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21. (30, 31.) which I intimate chiefly as another Argument of the lameneſs and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that character. We have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that our modern Presbyterians are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better than their Forefathers, if they do not agree with them and the Anabaptiſts: 1. In di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the Church under pretence of reforming it. 2. In labouring both by conferences in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and by Sermons in publick to draw the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people from their liking the preſent State. 3. In publiſhing factious Books to the view of the world. 4. In diſdaining and reproaching Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates for endeavouring to bring them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity by compulſion. 5. In ſlandering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling thoſe Miniſters that withſtand their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proceedings, attributing much good to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and pouring contempt and diſcredit upon their oppoſites. 6. In impugning the preſcript Form of Prayer. 7. In holding that the word of God muſt of neceſſity be preach'd before the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments. 8. In proteſting that they go not about to take any authority from Magiſtrates, even while they ſeek to overthrow the Government of the State. That the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts in <hi>Germany</hi> were thus guilty, and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians in <hi>England</hi> in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, I refer the Reader for proof to <hi>Oliver Ormerod</hi>'s picture of a Puritan, (written about thoſe times, and reprinted 1605.) wherein he endeavours to prove, that the Puritans then reſembled the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts in above fourſcore Points.

Whether the Quakers do not excel them in gravity, the Anabaptiſts in piety, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents in prudence, the Prelatiſts in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome Jeſuits in all four? and yet this Author ſeems willing enough to have all theſe parties rejected and depreſſed.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Beſides of inferior rank a vaſt multitude of knowing, ſerious, honeſt people.</hi>] 1. This alſo wants proof. 2. The more learning, prudence, piety, and gravity, thoſe of the ſuperior rank have, the more peaceably and quietly they will

live under lawful Governours, and the more obediently they will ſubmit to their Laws; which therefore if either they or thoſe of inferior rank refuſe to do, they are either leſs knowing or leſs ſerious and honeſt than in conſcience it concerns thoſe to be, who expect to be protected and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by Governors.</p>

Was it not an implicit Faith (in the ſeditious Doctrines of the Society of <hi>Jeſus</hi>) whereby they believed it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to take up Arms againſt their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign?</p>

            <p>[<hi>Wherefore impartial Reaſon will conclude, that they choſe this way as with ſincerity of affection, ſo with gravity of judgment; and that the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even the more diſputable part of them (as that againſt the Hierarchy and Ceremonies) are ſuch as may frequently prevail with good and wiſe men.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Which inference ſignifies nothing till the truth of the premiſes be clear'd, except the Authors confidence that the Prelatiſts have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve whatſoever he ſays in the praiſe of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, merely becauſe he is bold enough to ſay it.</p>

            <p>Dares this Author deny that the Principles of other Sectaries appear to thoſe that have embrac'd them to have the Impreſs of Divine Authority, and the Character of Evangelical Purity?

If he be not of this opinion, let him ſhew why Presbyterians ought to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and not others that have the ſame qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. If he be, let him produce convincing Arguments that other Sects have not all theſe qualifications, that is, that the Independents, Anabaptiſts, and Quakers were for the generality either Fools or Knaves, when they choſe thoſe ways. Beſides, does he imagine that the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Anabaptiſts, and Quakers are not as deſirous of due liberty in their way as the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians are in theirs? or that the men of thoſe perſwaſions are ſo lukewarm in their affections, or ſo inconſiderable for their number, as that the infringment of their liberty will not perpetuate moſt unhappy Controverſies in this Church? <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gò,</hi> by this Authors (Presbyterian) Logick, they ought in reaſon of State to be protected and encouraged as well as Presbyterians.</p>

(39) by moſt of this way [Unlawful?] Does not this argue a variation in this Party from it ſelf? Hath not length of time worn out thoſe their former Principles of ſcience and practice? Dr. <hi>John Burges</hi> (in his Preface to his anſwer in Vindication of Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> touching Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 11. that <hi>the State (in K.</hi> James <hi>his Reign) would never ſuffer theſe Ceremonies to be queſtioned of [unlawfulneſs] which Dr.</hi> Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, <hi>Dr.</hi> Chaderton, <hi>Dr.</hi> Spark, <hi>and the reſt of the moſt eminent men of this Nation, who ſeem'd to favour that Party, would neither affirm to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, nor be known that any of that ſide were ſo [weak] as to think ſo.</hi> But now it ſeems the men
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51388:15"/>
fam'd ſo much by this Author for their Learning and Orthodoxy, their excelling in Polemical and Practical Divinity, <hi>p.</hi> 23. (33.) theſe Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Prudent men that have no Fellowſhip with Anabaptiſtical Fancy and Frenzy, <hi>p.</hi> 24. (34.) theſe knowing and wiſe men, (<hi>p.</hi> 24, 25.) theſe fixt and unalterable men, <hi>p.</hi> 29. (39.) are grown ſo weak and feeble in their Intellectuals, ſo Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine in their reſolves, as to deem them unlawful. Again, if they are ſuch an invariable Party in their Principles of ſcience and practice, what's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that in theſe days they have Covenanted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the extirpation of that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchy which in the days of yore their Presbyterian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors were far from condemning as wicked and intolerable? Witneſs this paſſage which <hi>Crakan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> in his <hi>Deſenſ. Eccleſ. Anglicanae contra Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiſc. Spalat. p.</hi> 243. quotes out of <hi>Henry Jacob,</hi> one of that Party, who is his Tract <hi>de Veritate Vocat.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51388:16"/>
Government by which 'tis ruled, is the only true and legitimate Form of Government: and that almoſt all men acknowledge it indifferent and lawful: and that there are very few, ſcarce any men any where to be found who judge it evil, wicked, or intolerable. Thus he, who in the ſame P. is quoted by that Doctor as expreſſing himſelf to this purpoſe in behalf of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church-Government and Diſcipline. <hi>Haec verò Chriſti eſſe dicuntur, licet non à Chriſto ſed ab Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiâ mandata &amp; praeſcripta ſint, cùm Eccleſiae Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem Chriſtus dedit ea quae commoda ipſi viſa erant inſtituendi &amp; praeſcribendi. Ex hoc genere &amp; regimen Eccleſiaſticum &amp; Ceremonias dicimus, quia non ſimpliciter in Fundamento aut Verbo Dei ut perpetuò obſervanda traduntur, ſed arbitrio Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae &amp; Magiſtratuum relinquuntur. Sic nos de his docemus, tenemus, &amp; perſuaſi ſumus nihil uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in ſacris literis repugnans, ſed potius his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona reperiri.—Quòd ſi objicias multos inter nos ſocus ſentire, reſpondeo, Generale hoc eſſe &amp; Miniſtrorum &amp; Eccleſiarum Anglicanarum de his Judicium, etiamſi unus fortè aut duo ex cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenis aut millenis ſecus opinentur.</hi> Theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hierarchical Government and Diſcipline are truly ſaid to be of Chriſt, though they are not commanded and preſcribed by Chriſt but the Church, foraſmuch as Chriſt hath given the Church Authority to inſtitute and preſcribe thoſe things which to her ſeem expedient; of this kind we affirm Eccleſiaſtical Government and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be, becauſe they are not ſimply and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51388:16"/>
immediately founded on the Word of God, or delivered there as immutable Conſtitutions, but are left to the pleaſure of the Church and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. This is our Doctrine and opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things; and we are perſwaded that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be found in ſacred Writ repugnant, but ſeveral paſſages agreeable to theſe ſentiments: And if it be objected that many among us are of another mind; I anſwer, That this is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the generality, both of the Miniſters and Churches in <hi>England,</hi> though perhaps one or two among a hundred or a thouſand opine other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>But now it ſeems the Presbyterian party is ſo variable and alterable from theſe its quondam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opinions and principles, as to imagine thoſe Rites and Forms which the Church hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, unlawful, and that the Hierarchical Form of Church-Government ought to be extirpated. And if they are now changed (in their ſcience and practice) though to the worſe from what they were heretofore, why may we not hope that (if not meerly length of time, yet) ſome afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contingencies may make them change hereafter for the better from what they are now? I doubt I ſhould rather enquire whether there be any thing beſides this Authors bare word to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us that they will not ſtill grow worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived. Certain I am, the more unalterable they are in theſe their Fancies, the more miſchief they are like to do in that State that encourages them. But what kind
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51388:17"/>
of Argument is this,—The Presbyterians will not vary from themſelves, therefore they ought in juſtice and reaſon of State to be protected and encouraged by his Majeſty? Is not this as good? The Jeſuits will not vary from themſelves; thoſe Principles of Science and practice which they own and are actuated by, are of that firm and fixt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that new contingencies will not alter them, nor length of time wear them out: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Jeſuits ought not in juſtice or reaſon of State to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and depreſſed, but protected and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by our King and Kingdome. One may ſuſpect by this manner of arguing in the behalf of the Presbyterian party, that the Author of it was either a Jeſuit, ſince his reaſoning is ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to that ſociety; or an half-witted Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, ſo dull as not to diſcern, that ſeveral of his arguments conclude as forcibly for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Jeſuits among us as Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>But in this P. 29. (39.) 'tis ſuggeſted that <hi>the Presbyterians are [a numerous] Party—and that the impoſing of ſuch matters of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie as by [ſo many] are held unlawful,—cannot procure the peace of the Kingdom.</hi>] I might here ask whether the Anabaptiſts or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are not altogether as numerous as that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian party which holds our Church-Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies unlawful. Nay, are not the Independents themſelves as numerous? for I confeſs I am in good hopes that there are comparatively but very few Presbyterians given up to ſuch blindneſs of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51388:17"/>
mind, ſuch ſtrong deluſions, as to believe our Ceremonies unlawful. But my anſwer is this.</p>
            <p>If that Party be indeed ſo numerous that the endeavouring to reject and depreſs them will probably prove pernicious to the King and Kingdom, perhaps State-policy will dictate that it ſhould not be endeavoured. But I affirm withal that though they were twice as numerous, yet (unleſs their Practice contradict their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) there is no ſuch danger will accrue to the King or Kingdom by their rejection. For if this Author does not groſly abuſe and impoſe upon his Readers, <hi>p.</hi> 54, 55. The Presbyterians are ſuch learned knowing creatures, as to teach faith and holineſs, as alſo <hi>obedience active in all lawful things, and paſſive in things unlawful, injoyn'd by the higher power.</hi> Now they that are reſolv'd to be paſſively obedient, will not be inſtruments of miſchief in a Kingdome, (though they are never ſo numerous) they will live peaceably, neither railing with the Tongue nor ſmiting with the Firſt of wickedneſs; and therefore if the Presbyterians are indeed ſuch good men and ſuch good Chriſtians (in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) they may (notwithſtanding their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) be rejected and depreſſed (in State-Policy) becauſe of their other perſwaſions repugnant to the publick profeſſion of the Nation, ſince their ſuppreſſion will not prejudice the peace of the Church or Kingdome.</p>
            <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 30. (40.) (after ſome non ſenſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradictious canting in praiſe of Presbyterians,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51388:18"/>
for how can the inward ſpirit of Presbytery be ſaid to actuate <hi>their whole body,</hi> to knit them each to other, and to remain <hi>in full ſtrength and vigour,</hi> if ſome principal members of that body <hi>fall off and turn praevaricators?</hi>) Our Author enquires what thoſe great things are for which this ſort of men contend? <hi>Surely,</hi> ſays he, <hi>p. 31. (41.) they are no other than the lively opening of the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel, the upholding of all Divine Inſtitutions; particularly the ſtrict obſervation of the Lord's day, a laborious and efficacious miniſtry, taking hold of the conſcience and reaching to the heart, a Godly Diſcipline correcting true and real Scandals and diſobedience; in a word, all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and effectual means of unfeigned Faith, and holy life, that the Kingdome of God may come in power. And for theſe things ſake they are aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the height of Prelacy, and the Pomp of Ceremonious worſhip.</hi>] Say you ſo? It ſeems theſe godly Diſciplinarians do not look upon diſobedience to the Laws eſtabliſhing Prelacy and Ceremonious worſhip as true and real diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; nor the ſcandal ariſing from that diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as true and real Scandal; or elſe they implicitely confeſs that the Presbyterians thus ſcandalouſly diſobedient, were not chaſtis'd by the Biſhops ſo ſeverely as they deſerv'd. It ſeems they fancy that Prelatiſts are enemies to the lively opening of the pure Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to ſome divine Inſtitutions, to a laborious and efficacious miniſtery, to Scripture-Diſcipline, to ſome neceſſary and effectual means of unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51388:18"/>
Faith and holy life; whereas the only proof he offers of this Prelatical guilt is, 1. <hi>Their ſuppreſſing Lectures and Afternoon Sermons:</hi> which is nothing to the purpoſe, unleſs he had proved alſo that theſe are of Divine Inſtitution, or are neceſſary means of unfeigned Faith, and holy Life. 2. <hi>A book for ſports and paſtimes on Sundays enjoyn'd to be read by Miniſters in their Pariſh Churches, under penalty of deprivation.</hi> What? ſo as to exclude either Common-Prayer and preaching in the Morning, or Divine Service and Catechizing in the Afternoon? or ſo as to licence the abſence of any Pariſhioner from that ſervice either part of the day? 3. <hi>Superſtitious Innovations introduc'd; Si accuſâſſe ſuffecerit, quis erit innocens? 4. A new Book of Canons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and a new Oath for upholding the Hierarchy inforc'd.</hi> By whom? were not this Oath and thoſe Canons compoſed in Convocation, by our Church-Governours? were they not confirmed and impoſed by the Royal Aſſent? And why I pray was the new Oath for upholding the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy eſtabliſh'd by Law more ſuperſtitious than the newer Oath for deſtroying that Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy ſo eſtabliſhed? <hi>Far be it from me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>p. 32. (42.) to impute theſe things to all that were in judgment Epiſcopal; for I am perſwaded, a great if not the greater part of them diſallowed theſe Innovations.</hi> Theſe Innovations? what Innovations? The word muſt in reaſon refer to the particulars juſt now enumerated. <hi>viz. The new Book of Canons, the new Oath, the Book for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51388:19"/>
ſports and paſtimes on Sundays.</hi> But are theſe men in juſtice and Reaſon of State to be protected and encouraged, who dare to call new Laws either of State or Church, or both (occaſioned by new emergencies) Innovations? or new practices, ſuperſtitious, meerly becauſe not commanded in Gods word? Now theſe things are ſo far from being a proof of the inconſiſtency of Prelacy with the lively opening of the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel, with the upholding of all Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, a laborious and efficacious Miniſtry, &amp;c. that the contrary is evident from the inſtance of the Right Reverend Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> (whom this very Author, I believe, hath ſcarce confidence enough to accuſe as a Delinquent in thoſe particulars; ſince <hi>p.</hi> 67. (77.) he reckons <hi>Biſhop Morton in the number of thoſe Epiſcopal Divines, whoſe Doctrine is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrac'd by the Presbyterians.</hi>) Who yet did not only approve of, but had the chief hand in contriving and publiſhing that Declaration which allowed ſome Sports and Paſtimes as that which was then the moſt probable courſe to ſtop the current of Popery and profaneneſs, as appears from the ſtory of that Biſhop's life, publiſh'd by Dr. <hi>Barwick, p.</hi> 80, 81. So 'tis evident alſo from the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion, <hi>c. 7. De Poteſt. Eccleſiaſticâ,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Inſtitutions, that both he and the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Reformers were far enough from thinking the Lords day of Divine Inſtitution, who yet were for a lively opening of the pure Doctrine of the Goſpel and a laborious efficacious miniſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51388:19"/>In ſome following Pages the Author pretends to manifeſt, that <hi>the Presbyterian Intereſt will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be extinguiſhed while the State of</hi> England <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues Proteſtant. For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>p. 34. (44.) let but the Proteſtant Doctrine, as 'tis by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>be upheld and preach'd, and 'twill raiſe up a genuine off-spring of this people, whoſe way is no other than the life and power of that Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I as confidently affirm on the other ſide, that if the Proteſtant Doctrine by Law eſtabliſht in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be upheld and preach'd, 'twill raiſe up ſuch a genuine off-ſpring of true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, as ſhall own Prelacy and the Churches Authority in appointing Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, both which are eſtabliſht by that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but rejected by Presbyterians. If their way be no other than the life and power of that Doctrine, they act ſuitably to theſe Principles, <hi>viz. That the Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies; and authority in Controverſies of Faith:</hi> (Artic. 20.) <hi>That whoſoever through his private Judgment willingly and purpoſely doth openly break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ought to be rebuked openly (that others may fear to do the like) as he that offends againſt the Common Order of the Church, and hurteth the Authority of the Magiſtrate, and woundeth the conſciences of the weak brethren. Every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or National Church hath authority to ordain,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51388:20"/>
change, and aboliſh Ceremonies or Rites of the Church, ordained only by mans authority, ſo that all things be done to edifying.</hi> (Artic. 34.) <hi>They practically own the Kings power within his Realms of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and all other his Dominions and Countries, as the higheſt power under God, to whom all men as well inhabitants as born within the ſame, do by Gods Laws owe moſt loyalty and obedience afore and above all other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates in Earth. They act as if they believed his Majeſty to have the ſame Authority in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, that the godly Kings had among the Jews and Chriſtian Emperors in the Primitive Church. They uſe the Form of Gods worſhip in the Church of</hi> England <hi>eſtabliſht by Law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Book of Common Prayer, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, without ſurmiſing it to be either corrupt, ſuperſtitious or unlawful, or to contain any thing in it that is repugnant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. They are obedient to the Government of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Archdeacons, and the reſt that bear office in the ſame; not fancying it to be either Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or repugnant to the word of God. They do not combine themſelves together in a new brotherhood, accounting the Chriſtians who are conformable to the Doctrine, Government, Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of</hi> England <hi>to be profane and unmeet for them to joyn with in Chriſtian Profeſſion. They imagine not, 1. that any of the 39. Articles are in any part ſuperſtitious or erroneous; or 2. that the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of</hi> England <hi>by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51388:20"/>

They hold that things of themſelves indifferent do in ſome ſort alter their natures when they are either commanded or forbidden by a lawful Magiſtrate, and may not be omitted at every mans pleaſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law when they be commanded, nor uſed when they are prohibited.</hi> Theſe are parts of the Doctrine eſtabliſht by Law in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as is evident from the 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 5, 6, 30. Canons legally framed and ratified: But where are thoſe Engliſh Presbyterians to be found, whoſe way hath been no other than the life and power of this Doctrine? Have not their practiſes too loudly proclaimed to the world, that they have robbed the King of his Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical affairs, and traiterouſly placed it in ſome Lords Temporal and Commons? Is the metamorphoſing of our venerable Church-Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy into a thing called a Directory; the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our Church-government by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the caſting off of the Rites and Ceremonies eſtabliſht by Law, and fancying them unlawful; is this, I ſay, the life and power of that Doctrine before mentioned?

            <p>Which words, by the way, unleſs underſtood <hi>cum grano ſalis,</hi> will ſmell of Socinianiſm; but come out of the clouds, O thou Presbyterian, and tell us whether thou thinkeſt this to be pure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual heavenly Doctrine? <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers: Whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſts the Ordinance of God: And they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation. Be ſubject not for wrath only but for Conſcience ſake. Where the word of a King is, there is power; and who may ſay unto him, What doſt thou? Mark them which cauſe diviſions among you contrary to the Doctrine which you have been taught, and avoid them. The works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe:—Hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife, ſeditions, hereſies, envyings, Murders.—They that do theſe thing; ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. Put them in mind that they be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, that they obey Magiſtrates, be ready to every good work: that they speak evil of no man: that they be no brawlers, (fighters) but gentle (ſoft) ſhewing all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all men: Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves. Where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work. Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether unto the King as Supreme,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51388:22"/>
or to Governours as to thoſe that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil doers. Honour all men: Love the brotherhood. Fear God: Honour the King.

               </gap> to love their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to bleſs ſuch as curſe them, to do good to thoſe that hate them, to pray for ſuch as deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe them and perſecute them? Hath their practice manifeſted that they eſteem this imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divine goodneſs a piece of holy ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity? Hath their way here in <hi>England</hi> been none other than the life and power of that part of the Law of Chriſt? Have they accounted it a part of holy circumſpection to redeem time in evil days? to purchaſe to themſelves a longer time to do good in by all juſt complyances, by honeſt actions, by a fair civil carriage, a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſation, by bending in all thoſe flexures of fortune and condition which they cannot help? (<hi>See Dr.</hi> Taylor's <hi>Sermon on</hi> Mat. 10. 16.) Or have they acted as if they believed theſe other paſſages of Scripture to be divinely inſpired? <hi>If any man will come after me let him deny himſelf
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51388:22"/>
and take up his Croſs and follow me: Except you be converted and become as little children (in all humility and ſubjection) ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: Take my yoke upon you: Learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart: If when you do well and ſuffer for it, ye take it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, this is acceptable with God. Chriſt hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his steps; who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he ſuffered he threatned not.—In the laſt days perilous times ſhall come, for men ſhall be lovers of themſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, curſed ſpeakers, falſe accuſers, intemperate, fierce, deſpiſers of them that are good, traytors, heady, high-minded,—having a Form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof, from ſuch turn away. We beſeech you brethren that you ſtudy to be quiet and to meddle with your own buſineſs.—If any man love life, and would ſee good days, let him refrain his Tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile, let him ſeek peace and enſue it. Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ever ſee the Lord. The fruit of the ſpirit is love, peace, long-ſuffering, meekneſs, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Now ſpeak out man, is this pure ſpiritual heavenly Doctrine or no? Is the practiſing of it a duty incumbent upon all that would teſtifie themſelves internally renewed, or is it not? Is the contrary neglect an argument of an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſon? were theſe things written by the Pen-men of Scripture with ſuch Authority and Majeſty, as to beget in Presbyterians a diſpoſition
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51388:23"/>
and practice in any tolerable meaſure thereunto conformable? If this Author has the confidence to anſwer in favour of Presbyterians, let him evince or at leaſt endeavour to evince that their Covenanting to overthrow things legally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, their reproaching thoſe that would have upheld them as Malignants, Incendiaries, and Evil Inſtruments, their chooſing to take up Swords into their hands rather than the Croſs: their being ſo far from ſubmitting to the King as ſupreme, and the Governours ſent by him, that they reſiſted and maintained a long War againſt both. Let him, I ſay, evince that ſuch ways as theſe are the life and power of that pure ſpiritual and heavenly Doctrine taught in Scripture, and owned by all true Engliſh Proteſtants. Nor let him be angry that I handle him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and reply thus particularly to his ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous generalities; ſince the queſtion now being <hi>Whether Presbyterians are the beſt Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and whether on that account they ought in juſtice or reaſon of State to be encouraged;</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him, if he meant to diſcourſe pertinently and clearly, to manifeſt that they practically own thoſe pure ſpiritual and heavenly Aphoriſms in particular which ſo much conduce to the peace of the State, and the preſervation of the Order and Government by Law eſtabliſhed; and that they heartily acknowledge and embrace all that Engliſh Proteſtant Doctrine which is ſubſervient to that end; for otherwiſe the encouraging, yea tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them will probably prove pernicious to the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:51388:23"/>To affirm that <hi>the Presbyterian Intereſt is one chief ſtrength of the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, p.</hi> 35. (45.) is much eaſier than to prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let thoſe well known Principles,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which strike to the heart of Popery, be brought forth for evidence: viz. 1. The perfection of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in oppoſition to unwritten Tradition. 2. The Authority of Canonical Books in oppoſition to the encroachments of the Apocrypha. 3. The diſtinct Knowledge of the Doctrine of Salvation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every mans capacity in oppoſition to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith. 4. The reaſonable ſerving of God according to the Word in oppoſition to blind devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 5. Spiritual Goſpel-worſhip in oppoſition to a pompous train of Ceremonies. 6. The efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous edifying uſe of Religious exerciſes in oppoſition to the Popiſh Opus operatum, or work done. 7. The power of Godlineſs in oppoſition to ſplendid forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. I deny this Argument; The Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans acknowledge the Truth of theſe Principles; therefore that Party is one chief ſtrength of the true reformed Proteſtant Religion; for either, 1. they may own other Principles alſo which contradict theſe, and conſequently weaken that Religion: or 2. they may own together with theſe ſuch principles as are inconſiſtent with other parts of the Proteſtant Faith (grounded on and actuated by thoſe Scriptures before mentioned) and with the Engliſh Proteſtant Doctrine by Law eſtabliſht conform to them. 2. Perhaps thoſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51388:24"/>
ſeven Principles, as thoſe many Presbyterians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, who are ſaid to account our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies unlawful, are no part of the Engliſh Proteſtant Doctrine; but ſuppoſing they are rightly underſtood, with due limitations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, they are not all the parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrine, nor the chief parts of it, <hi>as it refers to Government and Obedience,</hi> which yet ſhould have been moſt of all conſidered in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of this Queſtion. 3. Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, yea, Socinians do as heartily embrace all thoſe Principles as Presbyterians, therefore he may as rationally conclude, that thoſe alſo are chief ſupporters of the true reformed Proteſtant Religion, and conſequently to be protected and encouraged in this Kingdom. 4. Presbytery may be extinguiſht, and yet theſe ſeven Principles (underſtood in <hi>ſano ſenſu</hi>) may be aſſerted by Prelatiſts, and conſequently the State of <hi>England</hi> may continue Proteſtant without Presbyterian aids. That Prelatical men aſſert them as well as Presbyterians, this Author denies not; only he ſeems willing, <hi>p.</hi> 36. (46.) to have it believed that the Presbyterian Party is [more] rooted and grounded in thoſe principles, which for my part I am ready to believe when I ſee it proved. But 1. This implies that Prelatiſts alſo are rooted and grounded in thoſe Principles. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>England</hi> may keep her ſelf pure from <hi>Romiſh</hi> abominations, though Prelatiſts only be protected and encouraged by her. 2. Till I ſee the contrary proved, I believe that Prelatiſts
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51388:24"/>
are more deeply rooted and grounded than Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians in thoſe and other Proteſtant Principles, <hi>ſo far as they are by Law eſtabliſht among us;</hi> in which ſence they <hi>ſufficiently strike at the heart of Popery,</hi> even by this Authors own confeſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 34. (44.) where he aſſures us (if we may rely on his bare word) that, <hi>Let but the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Doctrine [as 'tis by Law eſtabliſht] in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>be upheld and preached, and 'twill raiſe up a genuine off-ſpring of [ſound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;</hi>] and therefore <hi>England</hi> may continue Proteſtant, though Prelatiſts only are encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and Presbyterians rooted out; which therefore may be done in Juſtice and Reaſon of State, notwithſtanding this Argument to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>As for his ſtory, <hi>p.</hi> 37. (47.) I obſerve, 1. that the Engliſh Roman Catholicks are called a Faction in Religion, which is ſtrange language from the pen of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Agent. 2. That the Agent look'd not upon Puritans as Proteſtants, which as this Author tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 38. the <hi>Presbyterians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of as a palpable injury, and give evident proof, that they of right have as much Intereſt in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Name as Engliſh Prelatiſts.</hi> Now really I am much of his mind in this particular, if by Proteſtants he mean ſuch as approve of Subjects proteſting againſt the will the pleaſure of their Soveraign; and ſuch as deny obedience to the Edicts and commands of Kings and Emperors, or lawful Superiors: and if Romanizing ſpirits call this Puritaniſm, perhaps he well obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 39.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51388:25"/>
(49.) that the more primitive times of proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm were more leaning to it: (I add, than they ſhould have been) and I hope puritans have a greater portion of thoſe venerable qualities than prelatiſts: But if he mean by proteſtants ſuch as practically own the truth of the Engliſh proteſtant Doctrine, by Law eſtabliſht in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (in which ſence I ſuppoſe the <hi>Venetian</hi> Agent implicitly denied puritans to be prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants) I acknowledge the name of proteſtant in that notion venerable, (ſince in that notion 'tis a part of Chriſtianity) and ſhall be very glad if this Author can produce any evident proofs, that the presbyterians have any right to and intereſt in that name; which till he do, he muſt pardon me if I ſuſpend my aſſent, ſince himſelf has given ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther character of them, p. 22. and 29. (32. and 39.) and if he had not, their practiſes, eſpecially of late years, too evidently prove them to be creatures hugely differing from true Engliſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; foraſmuch as the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> excludes ſuch Animals from its Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Watſon</hi> in his ſecond <hi>Quodlibet</hi> and firſt Article, propoſes this Queſtion. [<hi>Whether the Jeſuits or Puritans be more dangerous, pernicious and noiſom to the Commonwealth of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>or any other Realm where both or either of them live, together or apart.</hi>] He anſwers thus: [<hi>The Jeſuits without all queſtion are more dangerous; not that their Doctrine is as yet ſo abſurd as the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans—in matters pertaining to Manners, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51388:25"/>
and Order of Life, nor that their Intent is manifeſted as yet to be more malicious againſt both Church, Commonwealth, Prince and Peer than the Puritans are; but becauſe the means and their manner of proceeding is more covert, more ſeeming ſubſtantial, more formal and orderly in it ſelf, and therefore are the more dangerous, becauſe of the two they are more like to prevail, by managing of whatſoever they take in hand; and the rather, for that their grounds are more firm, their perſwaſions more plauſible, their performance more certain, as having many ſingular fine wits among them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Puritans have none but</hi> Groſſum Caputs—<hi>ſo that if matters come to hearing and handling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jeſuits and Puritans, the latter are ſure to be ridden like Fools, and come to wrack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond Article the ſame Author propoſes this Queſtion: [<hi>Whether the Jeſuits Doctrine abſtracted from matters of Faith and Religion come nearer in matters of life and manners to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants or to the Puritans.</hi>] His Anſwer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is: [<hi>That Jeſuits are in this reſpect all wholly Puritans, and therefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>do ſome for diſtinctions-ſake call the one Puritan-Papiſts, and the other Puritan-Proteſtants.</hi>] Then he lays down a parallel between the Jeſuits and the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans in twenty five particulars: <hi>Some whereof are, That they agree in calling themſelves the Saintly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherhood, in ſcoffing, ſcolding, and ignominious diſgracing ſpeeches, (Puritans againſt the Biſhops and Engliſh Clergie, Jeſuits againſt the Biſhops and Prelates of</hi> Rome) <hi>in refuſing to have any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51388:26"/>
—in acknowledging no obedience</hi> (due, I ſuppoſe he means) <hi>to any Eccleſiaſtical dignity, though diſſemblingly they will yield it. The Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans labour to pull all Biſhops down, and to have none but Superintendents in</hi> England, <hi>and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made havock of all ſuch in</hi> Scotland; <hi>and the Jeſuits will let no Biſhops be in either Realm, if they can keep them from the ſuperiority over them. The Jeſuits check and controul both Pope and Prince, as at leaſt their equals; and the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans controul both Princes and Prelates, as if they were their ſuperiors, &amp;c.</hi>] At laſt he concludes, <hi>that the Jeſuits and Puritans do come neareſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in platforms, though both oppoſite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in intention as far as may be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The uſe that may be made of theſe paſſages is this: ſince the Puritans of former times were (if theſe pictures of them be rightly drawn) of ſuch an ugly complexion, 'tis no great wonder, 1. That <hi>the hatred of Prelatical Proteſtants againſt Puritans was</hi> (as that <hi>Venetian</hi> Agent obſerves) <hi>greater than againſt Catholicks,</hi> (thoſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, I preſume he means, who were of the <hi>Widdringtonian</hi> perſwaſion, in reference to the obedience due from ſubjects to Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;) for the <hi>Widdringtonian</hi> Catholicks were more oppoſite to thoſe Jeſuitical principles and practices which are ſo prejudicial to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Kings and Princes, than ſuch Puritans were. Nor is't a wonder, 2. <hi>That the hatred of ſuch Catholicks was greater againſt Puritans than againſt (Prelatical) Proteſtants:</hi> for ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51388:26"/>
differed from ſuch Catholicks, not ſo much about matters of Government and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as matters of Faith; but ſuch Puritans were oppoſite to them in both, in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Nor 3. was it wonderful that <hi>the hatred of Puritans was greater againſt ſuch Catholicks than ſuch Proteſtants.</hi> Becauſe ſuch Catholicks are more oppoſite to ſuch Puritans than Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Proteſtants are; for theſe Proteſtants differ not ſo much from thoſe Puritans about matters of Faith, as of Order, Diſcipline and Government; but thoſe Catholicks differ from them in both. Nor is it ſtrange, 4. That <hi>both ſuch Catholicks and ſuch Proteſtants did eaſily combine together for the ruine and rooting out of Puritans:</hi> for thoſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans entertained ſuch principles as were inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with that obedience, which both ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and ſuch Proteſtants (<hi>Widdringtonian</hi> Catholicks, and prelatical Proteſtants) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be due from ſubjects to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; upon which ſcore alſo both thoſe parties were eagerly bent againſt Jeſuits.</p>
            <p>And now much good may theſe [notable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations] (out of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Agent's ſtory) do this Author, who, <hi>p.</hi> 39. (49.) thus argues: <hi>Papiſts impoſe the name of Puritans on ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the old Proteſtant ſpirit of antipathy to</hi> Rome; <hi>therefore in the Puritan party lies the heart and strength of averſeneſs and enmity to the Hereſies and Idolatries of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi> Which is ſo far from being (what he is pleaſed to term it) <hi>a good Argument,</hi> that 'tis <hi>a mere ſophiſm,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51388:27"/>
he can prove that Papiſts [<hi>therefore</hi>] call ſome men Puritans, <hi>viz.</hi> merely becauſe of their averſeneſs to the Hereſies and Idolatries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but that they do not call any ſo on that ground, is evident from this, that they do not call all by that Name, who are reſolute ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Hereſies and Idolatries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Agent by this mans own confeſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 38. (48.) called that Faction in the Church of <hi>England</hi> [Puritans,] becauſe <hi>being ſeaſoned and initiated with the Doctrine of</hi> Calvin, <hi>they judged the Engliſh Reformation imperfect, and ſo refuſed ſubmiſſion to that Form of Policy,] en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to introduce a purer and more perfect Form of their own.</hi> This is Puritaniſm in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to that old Proteſtant ſpirit which animated our 39. Articles, and the Canons Eccleſiaſtical ratified by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and K. <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, ſuppoſe there were any Truth in this aſſertion, that the heart and ſtrength of averſeneſs and enmity to the Hereſies and Idolatries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church lies in the Puritan party, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are enemies alſo to thoſe ſeditious and rebellious principles maintained by ſome Papiſts, they are not true Engliſh Proteſtants, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they deſerve not to be protected and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by <hi>England</hi>'s King.—If mere averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from Popiſh Idolatries and Innovations were a good Argument of a good Proteſtant, 'twould prove Socinians the beſt in the world.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Thoſe Biſhops,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>who were heartily averſe from Popiſh Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51388:27"/>
were more benign and favourable to Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Which ſignifies little, unleſs he could prove it true of [all] ſuch Biſhops; but it may be he underſtands by [Popiſh Innovations] either the old Ceremonies enjoyned by Law, or ſome new Ceremony permitted and allowed, perhaps recommended, by Law; and it had been ſtrange, if ſuch kind of Biſhops as were heartily averſe from ſuch Ceremonies, becauſe they fancied them Popiſh Innovations, ſhould not favour Puritans. And again, If ſome Biſhops in the Church of <hi>England</hi> were more benign and favourable to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, 'tis no great wonder, ſince the ſame Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were (it ſeems) counted Puritan by the adverſe party. Indeed both King and Biſhops were more benign and favourable to many of them than they deſerved; which gave them lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and opportunity to grow numerous; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtrengthen their party, till at laſt they were too ſtrong both for King and Biſhops; for the loyal Nobility, Gentry and Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and when they had got the power in their hands, O what grateful and ingenuous returns they made them for that benignity and favour! They ruin'd the Biſhops, (not ſparing even thoſe moſt heartily Proteſtant Biſhops, who had been ſo benign and favourable to them,) they raiſed a War againſt the King; plundered, ſequeſtred, murthered thoſe that adhered to him, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees extorted from himſelf ſuch grand diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Royal Prerogative, as that they left
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51388:28"/>
him little more than the Title of a King: And are ſuch men as theſe ſuch true Engliſh Proteſtants, ſo good Chriſtians, as that they ought in juſtice and reaſon of State to be ſtill treated benignly and favourably? Nay rather, ſhould not King, Nobles and Commons (<hi>p. 40. (50.) remember their darling Proteſtantiſm?</hi> I mean, <hi>that good Engliſh Proteſtantiſm contained in the 39. Articles; by Law eſtabliſht in the Church of</hi> England; <hi>that true mean between Fanatick and Jeſuitical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm.</hi> Should not, I ſay, King, Nobles and Commons remember this their darling, and in reaſon of State abandon that ſort of perſons, who have contributed ſo much to the deſtruction of it? Let them not ſleep ſecurely, while the ſeeds-men of the envious one ſow the Tares of Diviſion in our Field, not only to weaken and hinder, but to choak and eat out our Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Faith, Order and Government: And let our gracious Soveraign ſtill ſhew himſelf gracious where his undeſerved clemency is like to produce happy (permanent) effects; but on the other ſide, let the miſchiefs that befel his Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through the ſtubborn Inſolency of ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diſloyal Presbyterians, make him wary in time, and circumſpectly provident for his own and the Kingdoms ſafety, leſt himſelf alſo know and feel by ſad experience what it is to protect and encourage presbyterians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 41. (51.) The Author takes upon him to vindicate Presbyterians from the many Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with which he tells us they are loaded. The
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51388:28"/>
firſt that he mentions is, [<hi>their plucking from the Civil Magiſtrate his power in Cauſes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, and erecting Imperium in Imperio.] Which,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is a groundleſs and groſs miſtake,</hi> and to prove it ſo he urges <hi>the declared judgment of the Higheſt of that way according to their own words,</hi> which are theſe.</p>
            <p>[<hi>To the Political Magiſtrate is allowed a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tactick ordering regulating power about Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs in a Political way; ſo that he reforms the Church when corrupted in Divine Worſhip, Diſcipline or Government.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this there may be <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Imperio:</hi> For the Kirk may aſſume to themſelves the power of judging whether there are ſuch corruptions or no; and whether the Civil Magiſtrate reforms thoſe corruptions in a warrantable manner or no; and conſequently of checking him in both reſpects if he chance to judge otherwiſe than they do, witneſs the next.</p>
            <p>[<hi>He convenes and convocates Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils made up of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons to adviſe and conclude determinatively according to the word of God, how the Church is to be reformed and refined from corruption, how to be guided and governed when reformed.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this there may be <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Imperio:</hi> For the Kirk may challenge to themſelves a power of convening without, yea againſt the Civil Magiſtrate's command, and here they actually challenge the power of concluſively
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51388:29"/>
determining how the Church is to be reformed and governed.</p>
            <p>[<hi>He ratifies and eſtabliſhes within his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the juſt and neceſſary Decrees of the Church in Synods and Councils by his Civil Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this there may be <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium in Imperio:</hi> For the Kirk may claim the power of determining whether its own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees be juſt and neceſſary or no; and of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in execution, though the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate deny to ratify them by his Civil San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>[<hi>He judges and determines definitively with ae conſequent and political judgment, or judgment of Diſcretion, concerning things judged and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned antecedently by the Church in reference to his own Act.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this there may be <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Imperio:</hi> For the Kirk may take upon them to controul the King (as well as private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) if his difinitive Judgment of diſcretion (which they allow to every [private] perſon, <hi>p.</hi> 20. (30.) in reference to his own act) ſhould chance to contradict their antecedent determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>[<hi>He takes care politically that even matters and Ordinances merely and formally Eccleſiaſtical be duly managed by Eccleſiaſtical Perſons orderly called thereunto</hi>]</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this there may be <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Imperio:</hi> For the Kirk may imagine that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51388:29"/>
in caſe the King refuſe to take this Political care, themſelves may appoint Eccleſiaſtical Perſons to manage them, and that their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is an orderly call to thoſe Perſons to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>[<hi>He hath a compulſive, punitive or corrective power formally Political in matters of Religion in reference to all ſorts of Perſons and things under his Juriſdiction</hi>]</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this there may be <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Imperio:</hi> For holy Kirk may deny her ſelf to be, in matters of Religion, under his Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>[<hi>He may Politically compel the outward man of all Perſons, Church-Officers, or others under his Dominion unto External performance of their reſpective duties and offices in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, puniſhing them if either they neglect to do their duty at all, or do it corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this alſo there may be <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium in Imperio:</hi> For the Kirk may fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the only or chief Judges of what are the duties and offices belonging to ſuch and ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and whether they neglect or corruptly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them.</p>
            <p>So that if Presbyterians grant no more power to belong to the King of <hi>England</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical matters, they deny his Supremacy and conſequently erect <hi>Imperium in Imperio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How they who <hi>give up themſelves to the ſole direction and Authority of the holy Scriptures,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51388:30"/>
p.</hi> 24. (34.) can (in reaſon) acknowledge a <hi>ſpiritual power over the Conſcience as intrinſecally belonging to the Church,</hi> I leave him to inform us; who would have us believe, <hi>p.</hi> 43. (53) that [<hi>Presbyterians do not claim for the Convocation or any other Eccleſiaſtical Convention an Independency on Parliaments.</hi>]</p>
            <p>That they do not claim it for a Convocation of Biſhops and Epiſcopal men I am apt enough to believe. But I cannot entertain any reaſonable hope that they who have Covenanted ſo deeply in the behalf of the Scotch Diſcipline and Form of Government, as to ſwear an endeavour of reforming things in <hi>England</hi> according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as one of the beſt reformed Churches) will acknowledge the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the decrees of all Eccleſiaſtical conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to depend on Parliaments. For, if Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> deceive us not, (Fair Warning <hi>p.</hi> 9.) 'Tis a Scotch maxime, that <hi>Parliamentary ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations can no way alter Church-Canons concerning the worſhip of God; for Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline ought to be exerciſed whether it be ratified by the Civil Magiſtrate or not. The want of a Civil Sanction to the Church is but like lucrum ceſſans, not damnum emergens, as it adds nothing to it, ſo it takes nothing away from it: If there be any claſhing of Juriſdictions, or defect in this kind; they lay the fault at the Magiſtrates door, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a great ſin or wickedneſs for the Magiſtrate to hinder the exerciſe or execution of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline. But we,</hi> ſay they, <hi>do give Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51388:31"/>
not what their duty is in their Functions or Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and this power requires an higher power of ſummoning, arraigning, and legally trying them; and yet the moderateſt of the Presbyterian Faction would have Princes queſtionable, tryable, and puniſhable by the Spiritualty.</hi> Which ſufficiently implyes that he thought not any Epiſcopal men guilty of that crime.</p>
            <p>From which premiſſes I conclude, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing produc'd here by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the contrary, this firſt charge againſt Presbyterians is a true accuſation, not a calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to a ſecond, and tells us, <hi>p. 43. (53.) There goes a voice that Presbyterians are Antimonarchical,</hi> (as if 'twere <hi>vox &amp; praeterea nihil.</hi>)</p>
            <p>[<hi>But are their Principles inconſiſtent with Monarchy, or any impeachment to the ſame? Theſe are contained in the character above writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But what if that Character of them be traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly partial, and in reference to the Queſtion here treated of ridiculouſly impertinent and abominably deceitful? whereof if this Author or any of his Brethren deſire farther proof, I may chance to ſatisfy their deſires before I conclude theſe Animadverſions.</p>
            <p>In the mean time let's liſten to his fine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Peradventure,</hi> ſays he, <hi>p. 44. (54.) the exact Presbytery, that is, the parity of degree and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51388:32"/>
Authority in all Miniſters is that againſt which this charge is directed.</hi>] Judge then whether that forementioned character, where that which is exact Presbytery is altogether concealed, be an exact deſcription of Presbytery. [<hi>Although this parity is not inſiſted on</hi>] Was it not inſiſted on at the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> Treaty? [<hi>or urged to the breach of peace.</hi>] He did [but think] <hi>p.</hi> 20. that moſt Presbyterians here in <hi>England</hi> allowed in order to peace <hi>Epiſcopum Praeſidem:</hi> but here he's more peremptory, and withal (it ſeems) ſo ſcandalouſly ignorant, as to believe that Tumults, Riots, Covenanting, and fighting in the behalf of Scotch-Presbytery is no breach of peace. [<hi>Neither is it eſſential to Presbytery,</hi>] whence I gather, that exact Presbytery is not eſſential to Presbytery: but was it not eſſential to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery contended for at the Iſle of <hi>Wight?</hi> was it not eſſential to that Form of Government which they had before Covenanted to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce?</p>
            <p>[<hi>Yet what reaſon can be rendred why this may not comport with Kingly Government?</hi>] A. Even the ſelf-ſame reaſon which ſome of his own party have (as I take it) made uſe of, to prove that Epiſcopacy cannot comport with Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> that it pretends (as ſome men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it) to be <hi>Jure Divino:</hi> which ſince presbyterian parity alſo pretends to, 'tis upon that ſcore inconſiſtent with Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as much as Epiſcopacy: the argument is as good againſt both Forms as againſt either. But

2. Since this Author is guilty, either of ſuch groſs ignorance, or ſuch Treaſonable diſhoneſty, as to make us believe, either that there is, or that he knows not any ground of this Accuſation, but what is fetcht from the presbyterian parity: I ſhall for his and other ſuch mens better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, take the pains to tranſcribe part of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a Letter written at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to Dr. <hi>Samuel Turner,</hi> concerning the Church and the Revenues thereof. <hi>Examine,</hi> ſays the Anſwerer, <hi>p. 15. the Presbyterian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and you will clearly find Kings and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand together; for either you conſider that new Government in the Scottiſh ſence, which allows no appeal to any other power; and then it's plain, that where men admit this they admit of a Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which doth not reſide in the King, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of two ſeveral ſupremacies within the bounds of the ſelf-ſame Kingdom, which can no more stand with Monarchy, than it can with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogamy, to be married to two ſeveral Wives; and though 'tis ſaid, that this Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meddles only with spiritual things, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the good of the Soul, and ſo it cannot hurt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal power, yet this is but only ſaid and no more; for 'tis well known, that</hi> in ordine ad ſpiritualia (<hi>and all things may by an ordinary wit be drawn into this rank, as they have been by the Church of</hi> Rome) <hi>this Government intrudes upon what things it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: and where a ſupremacy is once acknowledged, no wiſe man can think that it will carry it ſelf other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; ſo that King</hi> James <hi>his maxim was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51388:33"/>
moſt true, No Biſhop, no King. For that moſt prudent Prince did ſoon diſcern, that if a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er were once ſet up, which (at leaſt in the legal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it) did not derive it ſelf from the King, there was no doubt to be made that it would ere long deſtroy the very King himſelf.—Or conſider the Presbyterian Government in the Engliſh ſence, as it's now ſet up by the two Houſes at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>which is a Government limited by an Appeal to the Parliament; for either by Parliament here they mean the two Houſes, excluding the King, and then 'tis as plain as before, they ſet up two ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, his Majeſties and their own; or elſe by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament they mean the King with both Houſes; and then 'twill follow, that either there muſt be a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Parliament (which ſure the King nor Kingdom can't have cauſe to like) or elſe the ſupremacy will be for the moſt part in the Presbytery; becauſe whenever a Parliament ſits not, there will be no Judge to appeal to; or if it be ſaid, the Parliament may leave a standing Committee to receive Appeals in ſuch Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, then either in this Committee the King hath no Negative; and in that caſe 'tis clear, that the Eccleſiaſtical ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will be not at all in the King; or elſe the King hath a Negative, but yet is joyned with perſons whom he himſelf chuſeth not, and ſo moſt probably will be chek'd and affronted in any ſentence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give; and this clearly overthrows that which is already declared by Parliament to be a right in the King, as inherent in his Crown, that Eccleſiaſtical Appeals may be made to him alone in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51388:33"/>
Chancery,</hi> (for the Statute names no other) <hi>and that his Majeſty alone may appoint what Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners he pleaſes for their final deciſion: I ſay conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Presbyterian Government in the Engliſh Parliament ſence, and in the ſence of the Engliſh Aſſembly, (for the Presbyterians there are wholly for the Scottiſh Form, as appears by their quarrels at what the Houſes have already done in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,) and 'twill appear that their aim is not only to ſet up a new Government, but in plain terms, a new Supremacy: and hence, to ſay truth, he muſt ſee very little, who diſcerns not, that though the Presbyterian party ſeems to ſtrike at the Biſhops, yet their main aim is at the King, whoſe ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they endure not, as being a flower which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for their own Garland; and ſo though they hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically cry out (that they may abuſe the people) againſt the pride of the Lordly Biſhops, yet in the mean time the wiſer ſort muſt needs ſee that they intend to make themſelves no leſs than indeed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Presbyters.</hi> Thus he: And if this Author thinks this reaſoning inſufficient to prove Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Antimonarchical, let him tell us why.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it follows, <hi>p.</hi> 44. (54.) [<hi>Or would his ſort of men [Presbyterians] have no King to reign over them?</hi>] A. None, if he will not comply with their humours. [<hi>Doth a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick better pleaſe them?</hi>] A. Not an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or Anabaptiſtical Republick; but time hath been when a Presbyterian Republick (ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the two Houſes) did pleaſe them far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an Epiſcopal King.</p>

The man ſure would make us believe, either that our Monarchy was not diſſolved (and another kind of Government exected) or elſe that 'twas done by ſome that were not Covenanters. For why is not this Argument as good? Independents Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted to preſerve the Kings perſon and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: Therefore they never went about to diſſolve Monarchy? This is a much better conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: Neither the Engliſh nor Scottiſh Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians endeavoured to preſerve the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, juſt power and greatneſs, (the Juſtneſs whereof muſt be judged of by Law, not by the dictates of inſolent minds puft up with proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) therefore either they never bound themſelves and intended to preſerve it, or elſe they practiſed contrary to thoſe obligations and intentions. If he has the confidence to deny the Antecedent, I may chance to evince it to him before we part. Indeed his next words ſuggeſt a very conſiderable proof of it.</p>
            <p>[<hi>After the violent change of Government, they (the Presbyterians) came ſloweſt, and entred
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51388:34"/>
lateſt into thoſe new Engagements impoſed by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpt powers.</hi>] Which is an implicit confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: 1. That thoſe Engagements were inconſiſtent with fidelity to Monarchical Goyernment, and the Kings Authority. 2. That yet at laſt the Presbyterians did enter into them; whence I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. That whereas the third Article of the Covenant obliged them to endeavour (<hi>not only ſincerely, but alſo) conſtantly (with their Eſtates and Lives) to preſerve and defend the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Authority, juſt power, and greatneſs;</hi> they ceaſed to do ſo at laſt, when they entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe new Engagements, and conſequently did then break their Covenant. And 2. That the Presbyterians are not ſuch fixt and unalterable Creatures (as he would needs have perſwaded us, <hi>p.</hi> 29. (39.) they are) ſince they did upon chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Government vary by degrees from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and either deſerted thoſe principles which kept them from engaging with the foremoſt, or elſe contradicted them by engaging at laſt though ſlowly. And truly that they did ſo is tacitly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by this Author, <hi>p.</hi> 45. (55.) where he tells us, that [<hi>the generality of conſcientious Presbyterians never ran with the current of thoſe times;</hi>] which ſadly implies, either that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Presbyterians were not conſcientious, ſince they generally ran with the current at laſt, or that ſome conſcientious Presbyterians did, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the dictates of their conſcience, run with the current: For either he muſt mean, that the generality of Presbyterians [otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious]
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51388:35"/>
did [in that particular] by an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Conſcience run with the current; but this ſeems not to have been this Authors meaning, for then it follows (by his own confeſſion) that the generality of them were deluded by an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Conſcience into a breach of Covenant, which yet this paſſage is brought to abſolve them from; or elſe they muſt mean that ſome Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians conſcientious in this particular alſo, did run with the current, and then it follows that though they were conſcious of their duty to the contrary, yet they did engage notwithſtanding that practical dictate.</p>
            <p>His following Apologeticks are theſe, 1. <hi>That the Scotch Presbyterians adventured no more than all to uphold our Soveraign that now is.</hi>] Did they adventure ſo much as all? 2. [<hi>That when he fell, it was ſaid by the adverſary, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery was fallen.</hi>] No wonder if Scots adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured much to uphold that King whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved willing to uphold their Presbytery. 3. [<hi>That keeping company with the chief Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Miniſters, was objected by the Republican Council of State, as a crime cauſing</hi> (meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly I ſuppoſe he means) <hi>impriſonment.</hi>] It may be they were ſome ſuch Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as had quite forgotten the obligation that was upon them (by their entring into the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements aforeſaid) to be true and faithful to a Common-wealth-Form.

[<hi>That the Presbyterians by their influence firſt divided and then diſſipated the Sectarian party, and ſo made way for his Majeſties return in peace.</hi>] That Presbyterians have, where they are protected and encouraged, a faculty of dividing firſt and then diſſipating, I am not ſo envious as to deny: But 1. Either they had loſt this faculty in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time, or elſe they were very loth to exert it in the behalf of his Majeſty; the viſible reaſon whereof was becauſe <hi>Cromwell</hi> tolerated them in their Form of worſhip, and did ſo far protect and encourage them, as to continue them in thoſe places of profit and preferment out of which they would very probably have been ejected by thoſe Sectarians, who afterwards domineered. 2. That 'twas the Presbyterian influence which wrought thoſe bleſſed effects among them whom he calls the Sectarian party, I would fain ſee him prove, and when he has done that, he would do me another favour if he would tell me why he calls that party (which he ſpeaks of as divided and diſſipated) <hi>Sectarian,</hi> but let him take heed leſt he do it upon ſuch grounds as being applyed to <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will prove them alſo <hi>Sectarians. 5.

            <p>To the 1. (hoping that (whatſoever this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors words imply to the contrary) they were willing to come under the Yoke of the Laws of God alſo (at leaſt ſuch of them as they thought would not lie too heavy upon their Necks) I anſwer, 1. If they had been willing to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Yoke of the Laws of the Realm, they would long ago have ceaſed to be Presbyterians; that is, ſhakers off of the yoke of Prelacy and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies eſtabliſht by thoſe Laws. 2. If they had been unwilling to come under any other yoke, they would not have come under the yoke of the Covenant, ſince it was not injoyned by any Law of the Realm. 3. They have not ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves willing to come under the yoke of the Oath of Supremacy, (impoſed by Law) ſince they have been far from a practical acknowledgment, that the King of <hi>England</hi> is the only Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Realm, and all other his Dominions and Countries in all Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical things or Cauſes; and that the reforming, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, corrrecting of them, is by a Statute 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> for ever united and annexed to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown of this Realm; but on the contrary themſelves uſurpt the power of reforming, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, correcting them without, yea, againſt his conſent; and in ſo doing they enervated our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51388:38"/>
Monarchy, and rendred it too impotent in a chief part of its Prerogative; nay, too many of them are ſo far from acknowledging the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in their actions, that they refrain even from a verbal acknowledgment of it in their prayers; for when they pray for the King they make a halt at the end of thoſe words [<hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi>] as if the confeſſing him Supreme Head in all Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, and over all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons, were either Error, Hereſie, or a piece of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>To the 2. I anſwer, by demanding, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not as much (if not more) Law for the Kings impoſing Taxes (in ſome caſes) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of Lords Temporal and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, than there is for [their] impoſing them without the Kings conſent. 2. Whether the King and his Privy Council are not more compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of the exigency of times and caſes (in reference to ſuch impoſitions) than Presbyterian ſubjects? 3. Whether any Law of the Land for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the payment of Taxes impoſed by the King, without conſent of the three Eſtates, (<hi>viz.</hi> Lords Spiritual, Temporal, and Commons?) 4. Whether it does not equally forbid the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Taxes impoſed by the three Eſtates (and much more by two only) without the King? 5. Whether Presbyterians were not willing enough to pay arbitrary Taxes to the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Lords Temporal and Commons, though levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the Kings conſent, and therefore without conſent of Parliament? and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51388:39"/>
whether that be not falſe which this Author tells us, that they were not willing to pay Taxes levied without conſent of Parliament? 6. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſo doing they did not abundantly manifeſt, that 'twas not the arbitrarineſs of the Taxes, but either their being impoſed by the King, or elſe their being impoſed to ſuch ends as did not ſerve the Presbyterian Intereſt; that was the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their quarrelling with, and contending againſt thoſe Impoſition. 'Tis therefore too evident, that the Presbyterians had a deſign to enervate our Engliſh Monarchy; ſince, though they refuſed not to pay arbitrary Taxes to ſome Lords Temporal and Commons, levied without the Kings conſent, and on purpoſe to carry on a War againſt him, yet they were unwilling to pay arbitrary Taxes to the King, though levied for the defence of his perſon and Authority, becauſe levied without conſent of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Upon which pretence alſo their great Advocate Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> would fain have perſwaded them to deny the payment of the Aſſeſſments impoſed by thoſe powers that routed the Presbyterian Lords and Commons. That Author in his Reaſons why he would not pay Taxes, (<hi>viz.</hi> to the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Lords and Commons) tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 1. That <hi>by the Fundamental Laws and known Statutes of this Realm, no Tax, Tallage, Aid, Impoſition, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, Loan or Aſſeſſment whatſoever may, or ought to be impoſed or levied on the Free-men and people of this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>but by the will and common aſſent of the Earls, Barons, Knights,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51388:39"/>
Burgeſſes, Commons and whole Realm, in a free and full Parliament, by Act of Parliament, all Taxes not ſo impoſed and levied, though for the common defence and profit of the Realm, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, oppreſſive,</hi> &amp;c. This is ſound Doctrine, it ſeems, when Independents domineer, but in the time of the Presbyterian Tyranny Taxes might be impoſed and levied by ſome Lords Temporal and Commons only, without Act of Parliament, and yet not be accounted either unjuſt, or oppreſſive, or inconſiſtent with the Liberty of the Subject. The reaſon was, becauſe Presbyterian ambition was cheriſh'd and gratified by thoſe Taxes, which it ceaſed to be when Independents had the chief power of impoſing them.</p>
            <p>And yet we are told in the next lines, that [<hi>none more reverence their Liberties, and value the native happineſs of the Free-born Subjects of</hi> England (than Presbyterians.)] But what, I pray Sir, was in point of State-affairs the native happineſs of Engliſh men, (that had ſo much happineſs as to be born before Presbyterians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to domineer) was it not that they were born ſubjects to a Soveraign to whom belonged the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the <hi>Militia</hi> at all times, a negative Voice in Parliament, the Supreme power in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticals as well as Civils? and members of that Nation where the only legal Form of Church-Government was by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Archdeacons, Chancellors, Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where an excellent Liturgy was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be uſed, and no other Form of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51388:40"/>
Service permitted by Law? Where the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Surplice, Croſs in Baptiſm, Kneeling at the Sacrament, were (for order and decencies-ſake) appointed by the Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and the uſe of them enjoyned by Law? Is this the <hi>native happineſs</hi> that Presbyterians valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Or does the man mean by [<hi>native happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>] their receiving the temper of their bodies from predominant choler, phlegm or black me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy? and the complexion of their Souls (<hi>from Heaven ſhall I ſay?</hi> 'twould puzzle S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> himſelf to determine; I confeſs I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what apt to believe that presbyterians Souls are rather) <hi>ex traduce;</hi> from the prolifical, aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating vertue of the Parents ſpirit, which being immerſed in <hi>Hyle,</hi> and over-charged with ugly humors, is ſo far from generating a Platonical Soul, made up of Harmony, that its off-ſpring does more reſemble <hi>Galen's</hi> dull conceit of the eſſence of all Souls, and is of ſo baſe an alloy, that it little differs from a vicious, malign tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of body: I confeſs, I think none do more value [<hi>this] native happineſs</hi> than [<hi>theſe] Free-born ſubjects of</hi> England, but whether there are none that more reverence their Liberties, let the world judge, by their frequent meriting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere reſtraints for their ſeditious and ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal breaches of the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> by their paying arbitrary Taxes levied without conſent of King, Lords and Commons, ('tis an Argument good enough <hi>ad hominem</hi>) by their ſwearing to ſubmit their necks to the yoke of <hi>Scotch</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51388:40"/>
and Government, not allowed of by any Law of this Realm; was this to revere their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties? or rather to proſtitute them to the luſts of thoſe men, whoſe ſpirit breathed nothing more than contradiction both to mans Law and Chriſts Goſpel; to Civil conſtitutions and to the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>For whereas this Author, <hi>p.</hi> 47. (57.) talks of their true knowledge and ſence of the nature of Chriſtian Religion, and that this makes a due ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Freedom exceeding precious to them, 1. As I intimated before, 'tis not a due freedom from illegal Impoſitions, that the Religion of theſe profeſſing Chriſtians makes ſo precious to them; for to be inſlaved to Presbyterian Impoſitions, though illegal, is very grateful to them; but 'tis a liberty from Epiſcopal Impoſitions and Royal Sanctions, and ſuch Taxations (whether legal or illegal) <hi>as are not deſigned for the advancement of their intereſt,</hi> which they ſo highly value; and therefore 'tis manifeſt enough, they plead for ſuch a liberty as will enfeeble our Engliſh Monarchy. 2. I much queſtion, whether their high valuation of freedom from illegal Taxes, and their unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to pay them, can (in reaſon) proceed from any true knowledge and ſence of the nature of Chriſtian Religion. For I deſire to know of them, whether (at leaſt in caſe our Laws do not expreſly ſorbid our payment of Taxes, impoſed by the King out of Parliament) our Saviours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Matth. 5. 42.

On this occaſion I ſhall take leave to queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Free-born ſubjects had indeed a true knowledge and ſenſe of the Nature of Chriſtian Religion in other particulars, as well as this; for if they had, would not their practice have been more conformable to it? (if at leaſt that Axiom be true, <hi>Voluntas neceſſario ſequitur di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamen Intellectus practicum,</hi> which thoſe among them that do not Arminianize hold for a truth.) But whether their practiſes have been conform to the dictates of that Religion, let any one who knows thoſe dictates, conſider and judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially. They ſpeak ſuch language as this; <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the meek, Matth.</hi> 5. 5.

were: They had neither run themſelves into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger raſhly and unneceſſarily at firſt, nor after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by unlawful means preſerved themſelves from a legal Trial, and the ſtroke of Juſtice for thoſe miſdemeanors. But when reſiſting evil, and thoſe that offer it, can be reconciled with not reſiſting it or them, and with the ſuffering of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and much more pretended injuries: When rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing War againſt our Royal Soveraign, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it for ſeveral years, can juſtly be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted making peace: When the applying, <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> yea curſe ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 23. to thoſe that came not forth to fight againſt the King and his loyal ſubjects, can conſiſt with bleſſing and praying for thoſe that are ſuppoſed deſpitefully to uſe and perſecute us: when Dove-like harmleſneſs and Wolfiſh cruelty ceaſe to be contradictories: when to wreſt the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> out of the Kings hands, and to deny him his Negative voice, is to render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar's:</hi> when Covenanting againſt Prelacy and our Church-Diſcipline, and Orders, is all one with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and doing what our lawful Governours require: when putting up our ſwords into their ſheaths, and loving, doing good to, and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our enemies, is compatible with reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their perſons, with ruining themſelves and their Families, with turning them out of their legal poſſeſſions, with plundering their Goods, ſheathing ſwords into their bowels, and ſpilling their innocent and loyal bloud; then, and not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51388:42"/>
till then will Presbyterian practiſes be reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with Chriſt's precepts, and agreeable to that Religion which he taught the world, and which (as this Author well obſerves) <hi>is not variable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of man, but indiſpenſably binds every Soul, and is grounded upon an unchangeable, eternal Truth;</hi> (which if the Engliſh Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>J.

               </note> and if the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian profeſſors of this Religion, and of their own true knowledge and ſenſe of the Nature of it, had acted ſuitably to ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they had never thought it expedient to reduce his late Majeſty to ſuch diſmal ſtraits at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where they conſtrained him to grant them ſo much liberty, as miſerably enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Monarchical and Legal power of the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> whereby (whatſoever he cants in the following lines of <hi>a King's ruling over a free people</hi>) Presbyterians have ſufficiently taught us, that they take more delight in making good Kings their ſlaves, than in manifeſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be good ſubjects. [<hi>To be a powerful Monarch,</hi> ſays he, <hi>p. 48. ever a free people, is the freedom and glory of our Soveraign Lord, above all the Potentates of the Earth.</hi>] The more diſloyal creatures were thoſe presbyterians, who in that fatal Iſle treated with ſuch a Soveraign Lord, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51388:43"/>
once powerful Monarch, to ſuch bad purpoſes; as to deſpoil him of his Royal Freedom and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and by their imperious demands to dwindle this potent and glorious Monarchy into a ſlaviſh, ignoble, titular Kingſhip; whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture what a licentious, treaſonable liberty it is, that ſuch Free-born ſubjects breath after, and how inſolently they'l again exerciſe it (over our Soveraign Lord the King) if by his Majeſties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence and indulgence they meet with the like opportune advantages of winding themſelves by degrees into the like power.</p>
            <p>From which premiſes I conclude, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any thing produced here by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the contrary, this ſecond Charge againſt the Presbyterians [that they are Anti-Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal] is a true accuſation, not a calumny.</p>
            <p>The third Calumny (as he calls it) with which Presbyterians are loaded, is the charge of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Rebellion: [<hi>and this,</hi> ſays our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>were a crying ſin indeed</hi>] But yet he thinks it neceſſary to ſpeak ſomething Apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, at leaſt to mitigate the buſineſs, and remove prejudice; and therefore, <hi>p.</hi> 49. he tells us, [<hi>The Presbyterian party in</hi> England <hi>never enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged under a leſs Authority, than that of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament.</hi>] A. The word [<hi>engaged</hi>] is of dubious ſignification. 1. Did they never <hi>engage, that is, ſubſcribe the Engagement</hi> (to be faithful to the Commonwealth, as eſtabliſht, without King or Houſe of Lords) under a leſs Authority, than that of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51388:43"/>
2.

Nay, 3. Did they never <hi>engage in fighting againſt the King</hi> under a leſs Authority than that of both Houſes of Parliament? Is he ignorant that two thirds and more of the Lords deſerted that houſe becauſe of thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Tumults which drave the King from <hi>London?</hi> and that the major part of the Houſe of Commons left that Houſe alſo for the ſame reaſons? and that new men<note place="margin">

That the Houſe of Peers is no Court of Judicature without the Kings ſpecial Authority granted to them, either by his Writ or his Commiſſion, and therefore in the trial of the Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>and in all other trials upon Life and Death in the Lord's Houſe, the King grants his Commiſſion to a Lord high Steward to ſit as Judge, and the reſt of the Lords are but in the name of Jurors;</hi> and ſays J. <hi>Jenkins, p. 103. When the Lords had condemn'd to death by an Ordinance Sir</hi> Simon de Beriford, <hi>a free Commoner of</hi> England, <hi>they afterwards better conſidered the matter, and that they might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted of the ſentence, became ſuiters to the King, that what they had ſo done might not in future time be drawn into Preſident, becauſe that which they had done was againſt Law; and the Judge gives this reaſon againſt taking away mens lives by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, becauſe an Ordinance binds not at all, (but</hi> pro tempore, <hi>as the two Houſes then affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and a mans life cannot be tri'd by that which is not binding, and to continue for all times, for a life loſt cannot be reſtored.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which premiſes I conclude, that neither one nor both Houſes, though legally ſummoned
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51388:46"/>
and elected, have power to redreſs publick Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances or try Delinquents without the King's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>And as for that part of the Legiſlative power which is ſaid to reſide in them, and from whence their part in the Supremacy is thought fit to be concluded.] 1. The two Houſes, even when full and free, have ſo conſtantly acknowledged themſelves in Statutes and Acts of Parliament moſt loyal, faithful, and obedient ſubjects to the King their Soveraign Lord, that from this alone 'tis manifeſt enough they did not deem themſelves to have any ſuch part in the Legiſlative power as might entitle them to a part in the Soveraignty. 2. I have read in [the Rebels Plea examined] (<hi>p.</hi> 12.) theſe words, [<hi>Neither is it true that the Legiſlative power is partly in them, (the two Houſes) they are I grant to conſent to the making new and aboliſhing old Laws, but that is no cogent proof of the partition of the Supreme and Legiſlative power:</hi>] for which <hi>p.</hi> 14. he quotes theſe words of <hi>Grotius, c. 3. de jure Belli ſect.</hi> 18. who ſays, <hi>Multum falluntur qui exiſtimant cum Reges acta quaedam ſua nolunt eſſe rata, niſi à Senatu proben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, partitionem fieri poteſtatis.</hi> They are much deceived who think that the Supreme power is divided, if Kings will not account ſome of their Acts valid without the approbation of the Senate. I have read alſo in the Book called [<hi>The Kings Supremacy aſſerted</hi>] by Mr. <hi>Sheringham, p. 96, 97. That the concurrence of one or both the other Eſtates with the Monarch in the making and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51388:46"/>
of Laws is no good colour or pretence, much leſs a ſufficient ground for ſuch a coordination and mixture as is preſſed.—Although their aſſents be free and not depending upon the will of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, yet that makes them not coordinate with him in the Rights of Soveraignty. It's the common Aſſertion of Canoniſts, Civilians, Schoolmen, nor is it to my knowledge contradicted by any, that the Legiſlative power is delegable; that ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence is no Argument of ſupremacy, or of ſuch a mixture as ſome would infer out of it. Some call it therefore</hi> apparens mixtura, <hi>becauſe it ſeems to deſtroy a ſimple Form of Government, and to make a mixture in the power it ſelf, but doth not, though otherwiſe they acknowledge it to be ſuch a mixture as doth remit the ſimplicity thereof.</hi> Grotius <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms to this purpoſe</hi> (de Imperio ſumm. poteſt. circa ſacra, c. 8. N. 11.) Illam legiſlationem quae alii quàm ſummae poteſtati competit nihil immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuere de jure ſummae poreſtatis. <hi>He ſpeaks this of Laws made by general Conventions, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>doth not in the leaſt manner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Rights of Majeſty. Such a mixture of the three Eſtates hath been in other Monarchies, which all men acknowledge to have been abſolute in respect of power—as in the</hi> Perſian, <hi>which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from</hi> Dan. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>and the</hi> Roman <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire—And not only whole repreſentative Bodies, but divers particular free Cities have the ſame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, yet have not ſupreme Authority.—As for the enacting Authority attributed in latter times to the Lords and Commons in the beginning of ſome
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51388:47"/>
Acts,</hi> he affirms, p. 101. <hi>That 'tis only a power of aſſenting; for it hath been reſolved by the Judges, that this clauſe [Be it enacted by the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, and the Authority of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament] is no more in ſubſtance and effect, than that which was uſed anciently [The King with the aſſent of the Lords and Commons eſtabliſheth:] the words [aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] and [enacteth] being equivalent in this caſe; and</hi> p. 45. he tells us, <hi>that though the two Houſes have Authority granted them by the King to aſſent or diſſent, yet the Legiſlative power belongs to the King alone by the Common Law: the Authority that animates (a Bill agreed upon by the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) and makes it differ from a dead letter, being in the King, who is the life and ſoul of the Law:—which was reſolved alſo by divers Earls, and Barons, and by all the Juſtices in the time of</hi> Edw. 3. <hi>For one</hi> Hardlow <hi>and his Wife having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with the King, and deſiring to have it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in Parliament, a reference being made to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Earls and Barons, and to all the Juſtices, to conſider of the buſineſs, it was reſolved that the two Houſes were not coordinate with the King in the legiſlative power, but that the King alone made Laws by the aſſent of the two Houſes; that he had none equal or coordinate with him in his Realm, and that he could not be judged by the Lords and Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which it appears, 1. That that part which the two Houſes have by Law in the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power is not a ſufficient <hi>medium</hi> to perſwade
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51388:47"/>
us, that they have a part in the ſupremacy: and 2. That they have no ſhare at all in any power which may properly be called Legiſlative, (I mean in that ſence in which the words [Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power] are now adays commonly taken, <hi>viz.</hi> for a power of making Laws. (For among the <hi>Romans, Legem ferre</hi> was no more than <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem ad populum,—in concionem—quaſi in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um afferre &amp; proponere,</hi> and Legiſlation was no more than <hi>Legis Rogatio à populo,</hi> the propoſing the matter of a Law to the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, and asking their aſſent in order to its eſtabliſhment.) I conclude therefore, that the ſupremacy is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the King, notwithſtanding this inſinuation to the contrary. For the proof whereof, if this Author ſtand in need of more Arguments, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to <hi>the Rebels Plea examined, p.</hi> 11, 12. to Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi>'s <hi>Impartial Enquiry into the Nature of ſin, Appendix. p. 210, 211, &amp;c.</hi> To Mr. <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringham</hi>'s [<hi>Remonſtrance of the King</hi>'s <hi>Right,</hi> or, <hi>the King</hi>'s <hi>ſupremacy aſſerted.</hi>] To Judge <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> his <hi>Lex Terrae, p.</hi> 7, 8, 9. Indeed this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration alone is ſufficient to evince it, that by the Oath adminiſtred to all that ſit in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Houſe the King is acknowledged the only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governor in all Cauſes, (<hi>then in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Cauſes,</hi> ſays J. <hi>Jenkins, Lex Terrae, p.</hi> 127.) over all Perſons, (<hi>then over the two Houſes, (ibid.)</hi> which Oath every Member of the Houſe of Commons is enjoyned by Law to take, or elſe he hath no Voice in that Houſe. (5 <hi>Eliz. c. 1. Lex Terrae, p.</hi> 67.) Therefore
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51388:48"/>
the King is by Law the only ſupreme Governor, and conſequently it may not be thought, that a part of the Supreme Power doth reſide in the two Houſes. Our Author goes on, [<hi>And this part of the Supreme Power is capable indeed of doing wrong, but how it might be capable of Rebellion, is more difficult to conceive.</hi>] 1. Here he [<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently takes it for granted</hi>] that the two Houſes are part of the Supreme Power, whereas in the precedent words he ſpake more modeſtly, and told us only [<hi>it might be thought</hi>] that a part of the Supreme Power did reſide in them, <hi>not peremptorily inferring that it doth reſide in them.</hi> And indeed he could not rationally have ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, unleſs he had produced more cogent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to make good that concluſion. 2. Whereas he acknowledges the two Houſes capable of doing wrong, and tells us (only) that 'tis difficult to conceive how they may be guilty of Rebellion. 1. Notwithſtanding this Apology the Presbyterians that acted in and by Authority derived from the two Houſes <hi>may have been guilty of Rebellion,</hi> ſince the difficulty of conceiving how they might be thus guilty will not evince their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. 2. I demand of him, whether, 1. they are capable of doing ſuch wrong (to the King) as the Law makes Treaſon and Rebellion; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 2. if they do ſuch wrong it be not eaſie to conceive, that they are guilty of Rebellion and Treaſon. The Law of the Land (25 <hi>Edw. 3. ch.</hi> 2.) makes it treaſon <hi>to levy war againſt our Lord the King in his Realm, or to be adherent to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51388:48"/>
the Kings enemies in his Realm, giving to them aid or comfort in the Realm or elſewhere;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>to counterfeit the Kings Great or Privy Seal, or Money. The reſolutions of all the Judges of</hi> England <hi>upon the ſaid Statute have been, that to ſeize upon the Kings Ports, Forts, Magazines for War, is high Treaſon,</hi> Lex Terrae, p. 77. as likewiſe <hi>to levy War either to alter the Religion, or any Law eſtabliſht,</hi> p. 22. 40. or <hi>to remove the Kings Counſellors,</hi> p. 22. Yea, theſe things were acknowledged to be Treaſon, not only by Sir <hi>Edw. Cooke</hi> in his Inſtitutes (printed by an Order of both Houſes dated <hi>May</hi> 12. 1641.) but alſo by Mr. Solicitor <hi>S. John,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> in their ſpeeches touching the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> Where, as J. <hi>Jenkins</hi> quotes them, <hi>Lex Terrae, p.</hi> 187, 188. they likewiſe affirm it Treaſon <hi>to uſurp the Royal power, to raiſe rumors, and give out words to alienate the peoples affections from the King, to ſubvert the Fundamental Laws, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unlawful Taxes, or new Oaths, to levy War within the Realm without authority from the King.</hi> 'Tis confeſſed alſo by Sir <hi>Edw. Cooke,</hi> that <hi>no priviledge of Parliament holds or is grantable for Treaſon, Felony or breach of the Peace,</hi> (4. Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut. 25.) If not to any one Member (ſays J. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, p.</hi> 15.) not to two, nor to ten, nor to the major part. Now I ſuppoſe this Author is not either ſo ignorant or ſo perverſe as to deny, that the two Houſes did levy War againſt the King; that they counterfeited the Great Seal; that they ſeized upon the Kings Ports, Forts, Magazines
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51388:49"/>
for War; that they uſurpt the Royal power; raiſed rumors, and gave out words to alienate the people from the King: impoſed a new Oath, unlawful Taxes, and levied War without yea againſt the Kings Authority. From which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes I diſcern not any difficulty in deducing this genuine (though ſad and diſmal) conſequence, that thoſe two Houſes and the presbyterian party which adhered to them, and gave them aid and comfort, were guilty of Diſobedience, Treaſon and Rebellion. <hi>If the major part of a Parliament commit Treaſon, they muſt not be judges of it; for no man or body can be judge in his own cauſe, and as well as ten, or any number may commit Treaſon, the greater number may as well,</hi> ſays J. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Lex Terrae, P. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>[<hi>In this high and tender point it belongs not</hi> (ſays our Author) <hi>to me to determine.</hi>]</p>
            <p>The main reaſon of which ſcrupuloſity is moſt probably no other than this, that he's ſo much a Presbyterian, that either his blind and deluded underſtanding, or rather his diſloyal and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart will not ſuffer him to determine the Queſtion on the Kings ſide. For if this <hi>Rector of Bramſhot</hi> be not miſ-reported, he was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Preacher in a two-Houſes-Garriſon, and Chaplain to the Governor of that Garriſon, and at that time I preſume this was not look'd upon by him as a point too, high and tender. But now <hi>tempora mutantur</hi>—and yet not ſo chang'd, it ſeems, but that this Author ſtill dares to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Apologies for the former damnable Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51388:49"/>
practices of fighting againſt the King: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs theſe following words, <hi>p.</hi> 50. (60.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as touching the much debated point of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higher Powers, without paſſing any judgment in the great caſe of</hi> England, <hi>I ſhall only make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of the words of</hi> Grotius, <hi>a man of renown and known to be neither Anti-Monarchical nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Prelatical, which are found in his Book</hi> de jure Belli &amp; Pacis, <hi>by himſelf dedicated to the</hi> French <hi>King, [Si Rex partem habeat ſummi imperii, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem alteram populus aut Senatus, Regi in partem non ſuam involanti vis juſta opponi poterit, quia ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus Imperium non habet. Quod locum habere cenſco etiamſi dictum ſit belli poteſtatem penes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem fore. Id enim de bello externo intelligendum eſt; cum alioqui quiſquis Imperii ſummam partem habeat, non poſſit non jus habere eam partem tuendi,</hi> L. 1. c. 4. ſect. 13.] (which Chapter, by the way, is proved to be dangerouſly Anti-Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal by the Author of the [<hi>Obſervations on the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Government] p.</hi> 34, &amp;c. but) Here I demand, 1. Whether this Author can reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagined to produce theſe words of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> to any other end than to juſtifie the War of the Presbyterian Lords and Commons againſt the King. 2. Whether therefore his pretending not to paſs any judgment in the great caſe of <hi>England</hi> in not ſillily (and yet ſadly) hypocritical, eſpecially conſidering, 1 That in the precedent <hi>p.</hi> he takes it for granted, that the two Houſes had a part in the ſupreme power. 2. That the ſame Author, who inſers their having ſuch a part from their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51388:50"/>
having (as he fancies) a part in the Legiſlative power, quotes this very paſſage out of <hi>Grotius,</hi> to juſtifie the two Houſes and himſelf, in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encouraging others to fight againſt the King; which Author (yet) ingenuouſly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that he will <hi>offer his Head</hi> (he meant, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, his Neck) <hi>to juſtice as a Rebel, when, 'tis proved that the King was the higheſt power in the time of the diviſions, and that he had power to make that War which he made. He here implicitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> (Impartial Enquiry, Poſtſcript, p. 14, 15.) <hi>the King was once the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt power, and implies he loſt it by the diviſions; but that he never could loſe it, and that demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he had it, I have made moſt evident in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix of this Book, which concerns Mr.</hi> B. <hi>as much as Mr.</hi> H. (<hi>at leaſt as far as I have proved the ſupremacy of the King,</hi> § 78.) And that the King had power to make that War which he made (<hi>in defence of</hi> pars ſua, <hi>viz.</hi> the ordering of the <hi>Militia,</hi> his Negative voice in Parliament, his right to the poſſeſſion of all Caſtles, Ports, Ports, Magazines, within his Dominions, &amp;c.) is as clearly the opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi> in this paſſage, as 'tis that the two Houſes (<hi>in partem non ſuam involantes</hi>) had power to make that War which they made (to defend their own violation of the Kings Rights.) The truth is, thoſe words of <hi>Grotius</hi> are no argument of the juſtneſs of the late War on either ſide, and therefore they are impertinently produced to ſuch a purpoſe, till theſe <hi>minors</hi> are well and ſoundly proved: 1. That
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51388:50"/>
the two Houſes had legally a part in the ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf denies can be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from that part which they had in Legiſlation. And 2. that the King did <hi>involare in partem ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi Imperii non ſuam,</hi> invade any ſuch prerogative or part in the ſupremacy, (for of that only <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſpeaks) as did by Law belong to the two Houſes. For though it could be proved, that the King did intrench upon ſome priviledge of theirs, yet if that priviledge did not belong to them, <hi>quatenus having a ſhare in the Soveraignty, Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his words (though they ſhould be granted of infallible truth) will not juſtifie their fighting againſt the King upon that account. But this ſly diſcourſer was perſwaded, it ſeems, that when he had rehearſed this hypothetical <hi>major, Si Rex partem habeat ſummi Imperii, partem alteram po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus aut Senatus, Regi, in partem non ſuam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volanti, vis juſt a opponi poterit:</hi> Every Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian that underſtood Latin, and had engaged againſt the King under the Authority of the two Houſes, would willingly take the <hi>minor</hi> for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (<hi>Sed Senatus ille (qualis qualis) partem habuit ſummi Imperii, &amp; in eam partem (non ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am) involavit Rex,</hi>) and thence very haſtily and joyfully conclude, <hi>Ergò vis à Senatu iſto (vel potius Senatûs quiſquiliis &amp; retrimentis) Regi op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſita erat juſta:</hi> even by the verdict of <hi>Grotius,</hi> that man of renown. At this Presbyterian rate of diſputing are Arguments hudled up in the Book called [<hi>The Covenanters Plea againſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvers,</hi>] the ſophiſtry of ſome parts of which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51388:51"/>
Book is ſcarce exceeded by <hi>Knot's Volume againſt Chillingworth.</hi> In it ſeveral hypothetical majors are to be met with, but the minors are either not mentioned, or elſe preſumed to be true without any attempt made to prove them ſo. Now <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary Crofton</hi> tells us in his <hi>Berith Anti-Baal, p.</hi> 62. that [<hi>Ifs] are no proofs or demonſtrations—What good, duty, juſtice, morality, or religion may not be ruined, if a mans fancied [If] be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough againſt it? This way of diſputing as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Jeſuitical—irrational, Machiavellian, barbarous.</hi>

            <p>The Rector of <hi>Bramſhot</hi> thus proceeds [<hi>with reverence to ſoveraign Majeſty, I crave leave to speak this word of truth and ſoberneſs.] Partu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riunt Montes</hi>—one would think ſome very ſage and important Oracle ſhould forthwith drop from the Pen of this Reverend Dictator. [<hi>In a knowing age, quoth he, flattery doth not really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt or ſecure the Royal Prerogative.] Quid naſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur?</hi> Such a Triobolary Truth as I believe there's ſcarce any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſo ſimple as to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it. But there's ſomething ſuggeſted in it that I am afraid will one day be found a notorious and fatal falſhood, <hi>viz.</hi> that this hath been [<hi>a knowing Age</hi>] as to thoſe parties who have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ſought againſt the Royal intereſt; whereas I doubt 'tis far eaſier to prove, that in that reſpect it hath been either the <hi>moſt ignorant,</hi> (I mean of moſt grand, concerning Truths) or the <hi>moſt maliciouſly wicked,</hi> profligated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Age that ever Proteſtant <hi>England</hi> knew.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:51388:51"/>[<hi>The Authority of Parliaments being depreſſed and undervalued is the more ſearched into and urged.</hi>]</p>
            <p>By [<hi>Parliaments</hi>] here 'tis evident enough he means the two Houſes in contradiſtinction, yea oppoſition to the King: But ſays <hi>Lex Terrae,</hi> p. 80. <hi>The Lords and Commons make no more a Parliament by the Law of the Land, than a Body without a Head makes a man; for a Parliament is a body compoſed of a King their head, Lords and Commons the members, all three together make one body, and that is the Parliament and none other.—The two Houſes are not the Parliament but only parts thereof, and by the abuſe and miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this word [Parliament] they have miſerably deceived the people.</hi> And his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in anſwer to their Declaration of <hi>May</hi> 19. 1642. and to that part of it wherein they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that <hi>the Heads of the Malignant party have with much Art and Induſtry adviſed him to ſuffer divers unjuſt ſcandals and imputations upon the Parliament to be publiſhed in his Name</hi>] has theſe words, <hi>If we were guilty of that aſperſion, we muſt not only be active in raiſing the ſcandal, but paſſive in the miſchief begotten by that ſcandal: We being an eſſential part of the Parliament. And we hope the juſt defence of our ſelf and our Authority, and the neceſſary Vindication of our innocence, and juſtice from the imputation laid on us by a major part then preſent of either or both Houſes, ſhall no more be called a ſcandal upon the Parliament, than the opinion of ſuch a part be reputed an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51388:52"/>
And we hope our good Subjects will not be long miſled by that common expreſſion in all the Declarations wherein they uſurp the word</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>and apply it to countenance any reſolution or Vote ſome few have a mind to make, by calling it the reſolution of Parliament, which can never be without our conſent.</hi> p. 5. <hi>Neither can the vote of either or both Houſes make a greater alteration in the Laws of this Kingdom—either by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding or inhibiting any thing (beſides the known Rule of the Law) than our ſingle direction or mandate can do to which we do not aſcribe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>—And now let this Author ſearch his Law-Books with the exacteſt diligence and skill he can, and then let him tell us by what Law the two Houſes abſtracted from the King have any Parliamentary Authority. Indeed his own fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words do clearly enough imply that they have no ſuch Authority. For <hi>p.</hi> 51. (61.) he is ſo inconſiderately bold as to aſſert that [<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the utmoſt bounds and limits of Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Parliamentary power, the Law in deep wiſdom chooſes to keep ſilence, for it always ſuppoſes union, not diviſion between King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>] Whence all that I ſhall conclude is, that the power of a Parliament truly ſo called, <hi>viz.</hi> King, Lords Spiritual, Temporal, and Commons is not limited by Law; and thence I gather either that ſome Acts of Parliament are no Laws; or that that part of ſome Acts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'tis declared that any following ſtatutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariant to ſuch and ſuch preceding ſtatutes ſhall
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51388:52"/>
be utterly void, is vain and ridiculous. But 2. That the two Houſes when they uſurped the power of a Parliament (as well as the name) and acted in oppoſition to the King, had no Law on their ſide to juſtifie their actings: For if the Law always ſuppoſes union between King and Parliament, it ſpeaks nothing of the Rights and Priviledges of the two Houſes in caſe of their diviſion from and oppoſition to the King. And 3. That the Kings power and prerogative is abſolute, and notwithſtanding all Law of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion infinite, for if the Law be ſilent, and that in deep wiſdom too, as to the utmoſt bounds of the Royal Prerogative, it hath very wiſely leſt it unbounded: which latter concluſions (and the firſt alſo) are ſo prejudicial to the Presbyterian Intereſt and Party, that I doubt they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him either <hi>the veryeſt Fool</hi> (if indeed he knew not that the Kings Prerogative was bounded by Law) or <hi>the moſt Malignant Flatterer</hi> that this knowing Age hath brought forth.</p>
            <p>His next Argument to evince Presbyterian Loyalty is, that [<hi>The ſubverſion of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Government of this Kingdom could never be effected till thoſe Members of Parliament that were Presbyterian, were many of them impriſoned; others forcibly ſecluded by the violence of the Army, and the reſt thereupon withdrew from the Houſe of Commons.</hi>] An aſſertion ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe, that it puts me in mind of the proverb in the late War, that—ſome men <hi>would not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51388:53"/>
ſwear but they would lye baſely.</hi> The truth is, the ſubverſion of the Fundamental Government of this Kingdom both in Church and State was the great work of the Long-Parliament, which they effected in the Church, by overthrowing the Hierarchy and that Prelacy in which the Holy Church of <hi>England</hi> was founded (<hi>Stat. of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle, 25 Edw.</hi> 1. recited 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.) in the State by paſſing and preſſing upon the King that Bill againſt the Biſhops ſitting and voting in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (who were in all Parliaments either perſonally or by Proxy ſince we had any;) who were once of the States of Parliament, and in the Act of Parliament 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. acknowledged <hi>one of the greateſt States of this Realm:</hi> all whoſe Liberties and Priviledges, (and conſequently that of ſitting in Parliament, <hi>to which they ought to be ſummoned ex debito Juſtitiae, Cookes Inſtitut. 4. c.</hi> 9.) are confirmed to them by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which was it ſelf ratified by 32 Acts of Parliament, and that inviolably by the 42 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. enacting that <hi>if any statute be made to the contrary it ſhall be holden for none</hi> (and conſequently the Act of Parliament ſo called, againſt that Priviledge of the Biſhops, was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> null and void) by rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the King of his Negative voice, of his power in the Militia, by making Ordinances without him, yea againſt him, and ſo practically denying what they verbally ſwore, that he was the only ſupreme Governour in all Cauſes and over all Perſons: By their electing new members war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted only by a counterfeit Seal: By their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51388:53"/>
upon them to create new Judges, Juſtices, and other Officers without the Kings conſent.—<hi>For Laws and Liberties,</hi> ſays J. Jenkins, p. 146. <hi>have not the prevailing party in the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes deſtroyed above an hundred Acts of Parliament, and in effect</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>and</hi> Charta de Foreſtâ, <hi>which are the Common Laws of the Land?</hi> And p. 135. <hi>The Writ of Summons to this Parliament is the Baſis and Foundation of the Parliament; if the Foundation be deſtroyed, the Parliament falls. The Aſſembly of Parliament is for three purpoſes:</hi> [Rex eſt habiturus colloquium &amp; tractatum cum Praelatis, Magnatibus &amp; Proceribus ſuper arduis negotiis concernentibus, 1. Nos. 2. Defenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Regni noſtri. 3. Defenſionem Eccleſiae Anglicanae.] <hi>The King,</hi> ſays the Writ, <hi>intends to confer and treat with the Prelates, Earls, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, about the arduous affairs relating to 1. our Royal ſelf, 2. the defence of our Realm, 3. the defence of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>This Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſays the Judge, <hi>hath overthrown this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in all three parts.</hi> 1. Nos, <hi>Our Royal ſelf; the King they have chaſed away, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned (at</hi> Holmbey) <hi>they have voted no Prelates, and that a number of other Lords (about forty in the City) muſt not come to the Houſe, and about forty more are out of Town; the conference and treaty is made void thereby; for the King cannot conſult and treat there with men removed from thence. 2. The defence of our Realm,] that is gone, they have made it [their] Kingdom, not his; for they have uſurp'd all his Soveraignty.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51388:54"/>
3. The defence of the Church of</hi> England,] <hi>that is gone. By</hi> the Church of England <hi>muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood neceſſarily that Church that at the</hi> Teſte <hi>of the Writ was</hi> Eccleſia Anglicana; <hi>they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed that too. So now theſe men would be called a Parliament, having quaſhed and made nothing of the Writ whereby they were ſummoned and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. If the Writ be made void, the Proceſs muſt be void alſo. The Houſe muſt needs fall where the Foundation is overthrown:</hi> thus he. And all this was done before thoſe Members of Parliament that were Presbyterian were many of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and others forcibly ſecluded by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Army: So that 'tis very wonderful how this <hi>Rector of Bramſhot</hi> could be either ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or ſo impudent as to utter ſuch an aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially ſince in his own following words (which it ſeems he fancied to be a proof of its Truth) a very conſiderable Argument is ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to evince it an egregious Falſhood. For, quoth he,</p>
            <p>[<hi>They had voted the Kings Conceſſions a ground ſufficient for the Houſes to proceed on to ſettle the Nation, and were willing to caſt whatſoever they contended for upon a legal ſecurity.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Now in that very Treaty at the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> the Presbyterian party wreſted ſuch Conceſſions from the King, as did (<hi>in their own nature</hi>) ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Fundamental Government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as is evident from the ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> himſelf, concerning thoſe Conceſſions, (3. <hi>Edit. p.</hi> 38.) wherein he confeſſes, that <hi>the Kings of</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:51388:54"/>
England <hi>have [always] held two ſwords in their hands—the ſword of Mars in time of War—the ſword of Juſtice in time of Peace.</hi>—And p. 37. he tells us, <hi>that in thoſe Conceſſions the King had wholly ſtript himſelf, his Heirs and Succeſſors for ever, of all that power and intereſt which his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors [always] enjoyed in the</hi> Militia, <hi>Forces, Forts, Navy, (Magazines,</hi> p. 36.) <hi>not only of</hi> England, <hi>but</hi> Ireland, Wales, Jerſey, Guernſey <hi>and</hi> Barwick <hi>too, ſo as he and they can neither raiſe nor arm one man, nor introduce any foreign Forces into any of them, by vertue of any Commiſſion, Deputation, or Authority, without conſent of both Houſes of Parliament; and that he had veſted the ſole power and diſpoſition of the Militia, Forts and Navy, of all theſe, in both Houſes, in ſuch ample manner, that they ſhould never part with it to any King of</hi> England, <hi>unleſs they pleaſed themſelves.—A ſecurity,</hi> ſays Mr. Pryn, <hi>ſo grand and firm, that</hi> [none of] our Anceſtors [ever] demanded, <hi>or enjoyed the like</hi>—nor any other Kingdom whatſoever, ſince the Creation, (<hi>for ought that I can find) and ſuch a ſelf-denying condeſcenſion in the King to his people in this particular as no Age can Precedent.</hi> Thus <hi>the ſword of Mars</hi> (which themſelves confeſs the former Kings of <hi>England always</hi> held) was inſolently wreſted out of the late Kings hands, and conſequently the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Government of the Nation ſubverted in this particular. <hi>Beſides, ſome Parliaments,</hi> ſays he, p. 40. <hi>in former times have had the nomination of the Lord Chancellor, ſome of the Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51388:55"/>
ſome of the great Juſticiary, or ſome few Judges</hi> of England only; <hi>but never any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> England <hi>claim'd or enjoy'd the nomination and appointment of any the great Officers, Barons, Judges or Treaſurers places</hi> in Ireland; <hi>nor yet of the Lord Warden of the Cinque-Ports, Chancellors of the Exchequer, and Dutchy, Secretaries of State, Maſter of the Rolls, or Barons of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer of</hi> England, <hi>yet all theſe the King for peace-ſake hath parted with to us:</hi> And p. 41. <hi>we have the diſpoſal</hi> (he might have added, Horreſco referens) <hi>of all theſe Officers in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>both Military and Civil; of his ſword of War and Peace, his Juſtice, his Conſcience, his Purſe, his Treaſury, his Papers, his publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, his Cabinet, his Great Seal, more than ever we at firſt expected or deſired.</hi> Thus horrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was <hi>the ſword of Juſtice</hi> alſo wreſted out of his Majeſties hands, and conſequently the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Government of the Nation ſubverted in that particular likewiſe. Another Conceſſion was, that no Peer, who ſhould be (after that Treaty) made by the King, his Heirs and Succeſſors, ſhould ſit or vote in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> without conſent of both Houſes of Parliament, <hi>which,</hi> ſays Mr. Pryn, p. 43. <hi>gives ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary new power to the Houſe of Commons as they never formerly enjoyed nor pretended to. By which proviſion,</hi> p. 44. <hi>the Commons are made not only in ſome ſence the Judges of Peers themſelves, (which they could not try or judge before, by the expreſs letter of</hi> Magna Charta, cap. 29. <hi>and the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51388:55"/>
Common Law) but even their very Creators too.</hi> And (if the Houſe of Commons might juſtly be term'd any part of the Fundamental conſtitution of our Nation) what was this but to ſubvert the Fundamental Government? By other Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Houſes were enabled, <hi>p. 45. to make an Act of Parliament (for raiſing of moneys and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Militia) though the King denied his Royal Aſſent, which power was never challenged by, nor granted to both Houſes in any Kings reign before, and takes away the Kings Negative voice as to thoſe particulars.</hi> To paſs by other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (for I am quite weary of raking in ſuch a ſtinking Dunghil) theſe are enough to manifeſt, what kind of creatures Presbyterians were in point of loyalty, when they had power in their hands to be (<hi>impunè</hi>) diſloyal; and how willing to ſubvert the Fundamental Government of this Kingdom, ſince by vertue of theſe propoſitions, which they had the imperious confidence to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his ſacred Majeſty in that deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to which they had reduced him; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuded him of his Royal power, and veſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all the conſiderable parts of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and when they had thus ſubverted the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Conſtitution of the Engliſh Monarchy, and had paſs'd that Vote (which this Author mentions) touching the Kings Conceſſions, and were thereupon deprived by the Army of that power of impoſing on his Majeſty and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which they had ſo Tyrannically abuſed; theſe ſecluded and impriſoned Members wrote a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51388:56"/>
Vindication of themſelves from the Aſperſions caſt upon them by the Army; in one paſſage of which Vindication (<hi>p.</hi> 8, 9.) they give us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough to ſuſpect, that if their own proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had continued, they would yet more unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have inſulted over his Majeſty, and have taken ſuch a cruel advantage of thoſe great infelicities (into which themſelves had caſt him) as to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and extort from him ſome more diminutions (if poſſible) of that <hi>little power, and no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> which the former had left him; <hi>for,</hi> ſay they, <hi>by this Vote</hi> (viz. <hi>that the Kings Conceſſions were a ground ſufficient for the Houſe to proceed upon to ſettle the Nation) the Houſe did not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, as we conceive, the having no farther Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with his Majeſty, before a concluding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of peace; nor were the Houſes ſo bound up thereby, that they could not propoſe any thing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein the Kings Anſwers were defective, or from making any new Propoſitions for the better healing our breaches, or more ſafe binding up a juſt and righteous peace.</hi>] It ſeems then thoſe Lords and Commons had ſome more ſuch ſignal teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in pickle of their Presbyterian loyalty, ſome more demonſtrations, that when they took and impoſed the Covenant, they had no thoughts and intentions to diminiſh his Majeſties juſt power and greatneſs. It ſeems they had ſome clearer expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in their Budget of their meaning in thoſe words in the preface to the Covenant. [<hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before our eyes the honour and happineſs of the Kings Majeſties perſon and his poſterity:</hi>] which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51388:56"/>
words interpreted by their actions, muſt ſignifie, that they had it before their eyes, <hi>only as a mark to ſhoot at.</hi> But God deliver us for the time to come from the Presbyterian reſerves of ſuch a <hi>diſloyal and corrupt majority;</hi> wherein they abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſted how tractable Scholars they were to Scotch Teachers, and how able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to imitate, yea, tranſcend that ungodly pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern which they had ſet them, who, when the King had before granted them more than was fit for ſuch perſons to receive, had the inſolent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ask moreover ſuch things as 'twas not fit for the King to give. And thus the Engliſh Presbyterians by enlarging their deſires as Hell, fill'd up the meaſure of that Scorch iniquity, which he that runs may read in his late Majeſties <hi>large Declaration of the Tumults in</hi> Scotland, printed <hi>Ann.</hi> 1638.</p>
            <p>Our Author proceeds thus;</p>
            <p>[<hi>In thoſe times the Presbyterian Miniſters of</hi> London, <hi>in their publick Vindication thus declare themſelves: [We profeſs before God, Angels and Men, that we verily believe, that that which is ſo much feared to be now in agitation, the taking away the life of the King in this preſent way of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, is not only not agreeable to the word of God, the principles of the Proteſtant Religion, (never yet ſtain'd with the leaſt drop of the bloud of a King) or the Fundamental Conſtitution and Government of this Kingdom, but contrary to them, as alſo to the Oath of Allegiance, the Proteſtation of</hi> May 5. 1641. <hi>and the Solemn League and Covenant; from
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51388:57"/>
all which, or any of which Engagements we know not any Power on Earth able to abſolve us or others.</hi>] To which I anſwer:</p>
            <p>1. Though the Presbyterian Miniſters of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> were granted not guilty <hi>of [the death] of the King,</hi> yet they might be guilty of [<hi>diſobedience and rebellion</hi>] againſt him, which was the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>p.</hi> 48. 58. to which objection therefore this Apology is impertinent. 2. Nor is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy at all ſatisfactory as to the taking away of the Kings life <hi>in [ſome other way of Trial</hi>] it being deſigned only <hi>againſt that preſent way of Trial;</hi> for 'tis only with that limiting ſpecificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they vindicate themſelves; for they ſay, that [<hi>the taking away the Kings life in this preſent way of Trial is not agreeable to the word of God, &amp;c.</hi>] Whence all that I can conclude in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that they did not imagine it agreeable to the word of God, or the principles of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, or the Fundamental Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Kingdom, or the Oath of Allegiance, Proteſtation, Covenant, to take away his life in that way of Trial, <hi>viz.</hi> by that High Court of Juſtice ſet up by the Independent party; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this they might deem it conſiſtent with the word of God and the principles of the Proteſtant Religion, &amp;c. to take away his life in a way of Trial appointed and modelled by the corrupt majority of the two Houſes, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Lords and Commons: And if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Clerico-Claſſicum</hi> deceive us not, (<hi>p.</hi> 35. of his Anſwer to the <hi>London</hi>-Miniſters letter to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51388:57"/>
the General and Council of War, <hi>Jan.</hi> 18. 1648.) Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> allows of a capital proceeding againſt Emperors, Kings and Princes, in his Appendix to the fourth part of his Soveraign power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, <hi>p. 190. ad</hi> 194. It I am not deceived alſo, a man called Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Love,</hi> who I think deem'd himſelf a Miniſter of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, I am ſure he was a Presbyterian Miniſter of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> did in a thing called a Sermon at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi> Treaty, juſtifie, yea, urge the taking away of the Kings life in as bad a way of Tryal; for in that Sermon having ſpoken of the bloud-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the King, yea intimated unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrible-bloud-guiltineſs in him, and thereby made him the troubler of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Achan</hi> was of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he hath theſe words, <hi>p. 32. 'Twas the Lord that troubled</hi> Achan <hi>becauſe he troubled</hi> Iſrael; <hi>Oh that in this, our State-Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians would reſemble God, to cut off thoſe from the Land who have diſtempered it! melius eſt ut pereat unus quàm unitas, Immedicabile vulnus Enſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidendum eſt.</hi>—but yet more plain <hi>p. 37. men who lye under the guilt of much innocent blood are not meet perſons to be at peace with, till all the guilt of bloud be expiated and avenged, either by the ſword of the Law, or by the Law of the ſword. Mr. Love,</hi> ſays that Author, <hi>will not ſay that the King was not guilty of much innocent bloud, left he ſhould contradict himſelf; neither will he ſay that bloud-guiltineſs can be expiated but by bloud, leſt he ſhould contradict the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; neither can he ſay but the King was cut
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51388:58"/>
off either by the ſword of the Law or by the Law of the ſword</hi>—Whence I conclude that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe Principles of Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> the King's being put to death in that way of Tryal was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to the word of God, nor the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Proteſtant Religion, &amp;c. but a work fit and expedient to be done: and 'twill be well for Engliſh Presbyterians, if when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be laid open, it be not revealed to the world that the main reaſon why they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated the putting the King to death in that way of Tryal, was becauſe he was not tryed and condemned by Presbyterians, nor for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; but by thoſe men who hated Presbytery and would not ſuffer it to domineer any longer. For theſe very men could notwithſtanding both the word of God and the principles of the Engliſh Proteſtant Religion, notwithſtanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and Solemn League and Covenant, yea notwithſtanding the Fundamental Conſtitution of this Kingdom and the Oath of Allegiance, I ſay maugre all theſe obligations to the contrary (if at leaſt, one of them be ſuch an obligation) theſe very men could join with the Presbyterian Lords and Commons in making War againſt the King, and ſend an Army to ſhed his bloud in the high places of the Field; and therefore if Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians be Proteſtants, and their Religion the Proteſtant Religion, 'twas not their Loyalty but the divine goodneſs and providence wonderfully interpoſing for the Kings ſafety, that in ſo many battels kept the Proteſtant Religion from being
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51388:58"/>
ſtained with the bloud of a King; eſpecially as to <hi>Edge-Hill</hi>-fight, if that be true which is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in <hi>Fabian Philips</hi> his <hi>Veritas inconcuſſa, p.</hi> 79. that <hi>Blague, a villain in the Kings Army, had a great penſion allowed him that he might give notice in what part of the Field the King ſtood, that they might the better know how to ſhoot at him:</hi> who accordingly gave notice of it, and if God had not had a greater care of his Anointed than of their Rebellious pretences, that Bullet from the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Canon which graz'd at the King's Heels as he was Kneeling at his prayers on the ſide of a bank had taken away his life; and the Presbyterian Religion, (ſuch as it is) had been ſtained with the bloud of a King. <hi>And though the Presbyterians</hi> (as the Apology for Biſhops ſitting and voting in Parliament tells us, <hi>p. 69.) would excuſe themſelves that they never intended the Kings deſtruction, yet that is a frivolous and fooliſh excuſe: For as Sir</hi> Walter Rawleigh <hi>ſays truly, Our Law doth conſtrue all levying War without the Kings Commiſſion, and all force raiſed, to be intended for the death and deſtruction of the King, not attending the ſequel, and ſo 'tis judged upon good reaſon; for every unlawful and ill action is ſuppoſed to be accompanied with an ill intent. The Lord</hi> Cook (as the Apologizer goes on, <hi>p.</hi> 70. ſpeaking fully of all kinds and degrees of Treaſon, 3 Inſtitut. <hi>p.</hi> 12. ſaith,) <hi>Preparation by ſome overt act to depoſe the King, or take the King by force and ſtrong hand, and to impriſon him until he hath yielded to certain demands, is a ſufficient
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51388:59"/>
overt Act to prove the compaſſing and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the death of the King: For this upon the matter is to make the King a Subject, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil him of his Kingly office of Royal Government, and ſo it was reſolved by all the Judges of</hi> England, Hill. 1 Jac. Regis, <hi>in the caſe of the Lord</hi> Cobham, <hi>Lord</hi> Grey, <hi>and</hi> Watſon <hi>and</hi> Clark <hi>Seminary Prieſts; and ſo it had been reſolved by the Juſtices,</hi> Hill. 43 Eliz. <hi>in the caſe of the Earls of</hi> Eſſex <hi>and</hi> Southampton, <hi>who intended to go to the Court where the Queen was, and to have taken her into their power, and to have removed divers of her Council; and for that end did aſſemble a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, which being raiſed to the end afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, was a ſufficient overt Act for compaſſing the death of the Queen.—The Presbyterians,</hi> ſays he, <hi>did offend in this kind notoriouſly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committed Treaſon manifeſtly; for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned the King in divers places, and at length in a remote place in the Iſle of</hi> Wight—<hi>and all this done by them who were for the moſt part Presbyterians, out of their deſign to compel the King to yield to their projects, to overthrow the Biſhops and to take their Lands and their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.</hi>—From this we may judge how agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Presbyterian actions were to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Law of this Kingdom; and how manifeſt it is that <hi>they muſt in Law be reckoned King-killers</hi> as well as the Army; and if the Law of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion damn them to ſuch a guilt and puniſhment on earth, there is no Goſpel that I know of will ſave them from Hell without a repentance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable

to their Crimes, which (for ought I ſee) they are hitherto ſo far from thinking a duty, that they rather go about to juſtifie their former actings by returning again (as far as they dare) to the ſame follies that uſhered in their former war and at firſt embrued the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in bloud. Nor do I believe that they who took away the Kings life in that way of Trial acted upon any more treaſonable and rebellious Principles, than are owned and taught <hi>by ſome Presbyterian writers of the firſt magnitude, both French, Scotch and Engliſh.</hi> The truth whereof I doubt will be very evident to him that can get and will peruſe theſe Presbyterian Scripts. <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan's de jure regni apud Scotos.

To this objection [<hi>God places Tyrants ſometimes for the puniſhment of his people</hi>] this anſwer (given by the Reverend <hi>Bucanan) ſo doth he private men ſometimes to Kill them. And this new Divinity,</hi> ſays the Biſhop, <hi>of dealing thus with Kings and Princes, is not held only by</hi> Knox <hi>and</hi> Bucanan, <hi>but generally for ought I can learn by moſt of the Conſiſtorians of chief name beyond the Seas, who being of the</hi> Geneva <hi>humour, do endeavour by moſt unjuſt and diſloyal means to ſubject to their forged Presbyteries the Scepters and Swords of Kings and Princes, as</hi> Calvin, Beza, Hottoman,

Urſin (<hi>as he cometh out from</hi> Newſtadt) vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae contra Tyrannos. Euſebius, Philadelphus, &amp;c. Theſe alſo B. 2. Ch. 1. I find out of <hi>Goodman. Evil Princes ought by the Law of God to be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and inferiour Magiſtrates ought chiefly to do it—It is lawful to kill wicked Kings and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants—when Magiſtrates ceaſe to do their duties, (in thus depoſing or killing Princes) the people are as it were without officers, and then God gives the ſword into their hands, and he himſelf is become immediately their Head, for to the multitude a portion of the Sword of Juſtice is committed.</hi> And out of him and a Book of Obedience, theſe: <hi>If neither the inferiour Magiſtrates nor the greateſt part of the people will do their Offices (in puniſhing, depoſing, or killing of Princes) then the Miniſter muſt excommunicate ſuch a King; any Miniſter may do it againſt the greateſt Prince. God will ſend to the reſt of the people who are willing to do their duty but not able, ſome</hi> Moſes <hi>or</hi> Othoniel.—<hi>by the word of God a private man having ſome ſpecial inward motion may kill a Tyrant—Or otherwiſe a private man may do ſo if he be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or permitted by the Commonwealth.</hi> Now if ſome inferiour Magiſtrate, a handful of the people, yea one man may kill a Tyrant, an evil Prince, one that refuſes to reform Religion, this implyes that the ſame perſon or perſons may be a Judge or Judges, whether ſuch or ſuch a King be a Tyrant, an evil Prince, a refuſer to reform, and conſequently one that deſerves death or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:51388:61"/>Upon ſuch wicked principles as theſe (dictated and taught by Presbyterian Oracles) in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with this <hi>minor,</hi> that the late King was a perſon ſo criminal as to deſerve death, which they that ordered his Trial took upon them to be Judges of, as they might well by theſe now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned principles, horrid Regicide was pathetically recommended (to his Auditors at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi>-Treaty) by Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Love,</hi> a Presbyterian Miniſter of <hi>London;</hi> and long after that perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by Order of a part of the people, ſome Commons and the High Court of Juſtice, who adjudged the King to be thus criminous; and apologiz'd for by <hi>John Price,</hi> Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> in his <hi>Clerico-Claſſicum,</hi> as an Act agreeable enough to the declared judgment of many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant (<hi>he means Presbyterian</hi>) Divines, in teſtimony whereof he quotes ſeveral paſſages <hi>out of Presbyterian Authors, p.</hi> 32. to 35. which pamphlet, if the Title-page deceive us not, may ſerve as a brief anſwer to that Vindication of the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters here ſpoken of. And indeed 'tis a diſcourſe ſo abounding with ſtrong and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Arguments <hi>ad homines,</hi> that I doubt 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the skill of a Presbyterian to give a ſolid and ſatisfactory reply to it. From all which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that either the presbyterian Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> muſt damn the now mentioned Principles and Tenents of thoſe their presbyterian Anceſtors, and their own opinions alſo at the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi>-Treaty, if they were the ſame with Mr. <hi>Love</hi>'s, one of their Tribe, or elſe they muſt juſtifie this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51388:61"/>
inference, <hi>That the taking away the life of the King in that (then) preſent way of Trial, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a duty than a crime:</hi> Which though it be a wretched and Traiterous concluſion, yet is very regularly deducible from thoſe principles.</p>
            <p>And I appeal to any intelligent and ingenuous perſons, and deſire them to tell me, whether the murderers of the late King did infer that bloudy Corollary from any more treaſonable and rebellious Theorems and Conſectaries, than theſe which I have now produced; and whether Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents did not in juſtifying that horrid Fact, write exactly after thoſe Copies, which Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians both ancient and modern had ſet them. And hence I think I may reaſonably affirm, that thoſe principles of the Proteſtant Religion, which are contrary to King-killing, are no otherwiſe owned by ſuch Presbyterians, as I have now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, than as moſt Presbyterians ſay, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts own ſome Articles of our Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, becauſe they hold together with them other principles which conſequentially overthrow thoſe Articles. And therefore 'twas but a vanity in the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters to vindicate themſelves, by ſpeaking of thoſe principles as oppoſite to that way of Trial: a greater folly was it to produce the ſolemn League and Covenant, which in the third Article talks ſo looſely and crudely of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Kings perſon and Authority, that Presbyterians might without offering any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the words, plunder him of all his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and both they and the Independents take
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51388:62"/>
away his life, notwithſtanding that Article, whenſoever they ſhould think fit to determine, that the true Religion and Libertie of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms could not be defended and preſerved, unleſs the Kings perſon and Authority were deſtroyed: But in the fourth Article there's as clear and ſmooth a way opened to the commiſſion of that heinous ſin, as the moſt forward Actors in it needed to deſire; for there the Covenanters are bound with all faithfulneſs to endeavour the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of all ſuch as have been or ſhall be Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, Malignants, evil Inſtruments, that they may be brought to publick Trial, and receive condign puniſhment, not only as the degree of their offences required or deſerved, but alſo <hi>as the Supreme Judicatories</hi> (whether <hi>de facto</hi> or <hi>de jure,</hi> we are not certified) <hi>of both Kingdoms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, or others having power from them for that effect ſhould judge convenient:</hi> So that ſince the men who ordered the Trial of the King were at that time <hi>de facto</hi> the ſupreme Judicatory of <hi>England;</hi> and ſince they look'd upon him as an Incendiary and evil Inſtrument, and therefore to be brought to publick Trial, and the men impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them judged it to be (at leaſt) convenient to take away his life in that way of Trial; their murdering of Him in that way was not contrary, but agreeable enough to the Solemn League and Covenant: Yea, to imagine that by that League <hi>Scotland</hi> was bound to reſcue the Kings perſon from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe of their Voting, that no farther application or Addreſſes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51388:62"/>
ſhould be made to his Majeſty, under pain of High Treaſon, is called a ſlandering of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in that humble <hi>Edenburgh</hi>-Remonſtrance, <hi>p.</hi> 45. Nor is either the Proteſtation of <hi>May</hi> 5. 1641. or the Oath of Allegiance, or the word of God, more wiſely or pertinently urged by thoſe <hi>London</hi> Miniſters againſt thoſe murderers, ſince all thoſe obligations do as much forbid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>fighting againſt the King, and diſhonouring; and dethroning him,</hi> which Presbyterians were abundantly guilty of, as they do <hi>putting him to death,</hi> which the Independents did, ('tis true) but after the Presbyterians had firſt ſtript him of his honour, and Royal State, and ſo <hi>politically killed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which conſidered, 'tis very admirable to me, that thoſe Presbyterian Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> (eſpecially Mr. <hi>Love</hi>) could ſo confidently talk thus in vindication of their own Innocency, and in oppoſition to thoſe Independent malefactors, as alſo with what face they could (as our Author tells us they did, <hi>p. 52-62.) warn and exhort men to pray for the King, that God would reſtrain the violence of men, that they might not dare to draw upon themſelves and the Kingdom the bloud of their Soveraign.</hi>] To uſe his own words, [<hi>Let prudent men weigh things in the balance of reaſon,</hi>] and tell us whether it were not a piece of practical Non-ſence and contradictious hypocriſie, for thoſe Prieſts who had imployed themſelves ſo many years together in curſing thoſe that fought not againſt the King, and bleſſing thoſe that did,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51388:63"/>
to warn and exhort men (at laſt) to pray that God would reſtrain the violence of men, and not ſuffer them to draw upon themſelves and the Kingdom the bloud of their Soveraign. If they had exhorted men to put up ſuch a petition in the time of the Wars, would they not thereby have expoſed themſelves to the ſcorn and deriſion of their Auditors? Yea, would not their own Lords and Commons have treated them as Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, Malignants, evil Inſtruments; or were they ſo ſottiſh as to imagine that there's ſo great difference between a Camp and a Scaffold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Army of Rebels, and a ſingle Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, that 'twas a duty to pray to God to protect the King from the danger of the one, but no duty to pray for his ſafeguard from the aſſaults of the other? Or did they indeed believe if the King had been mortally wounded in the Field (at <hi>Edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, Newbery,</hi> or <hi>Naſeby,</hi> by one or more of the Presbyterian Souldiers) that this had not been <hi>violence,</hi> or that the Presbyterian Lords and Commons had not thereby <hi>drawn upon themſelves and the Kingdom the bloud of their Soveraign?</hi> I ſeriouſly profeſs, that the more narrowly I ſearch into theſe things, the more reaſon I have to fear (what indeed this very Vindication ſuggeſts) that had the Kings life been taken away, <hi>either by Presbyterian Armies in the Field (the law of the Sword) or by order of Presbyterian Judges on a Scaffold (the Sword of their Law) for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Presbyterian Intereſt, they would eaſily have believed ſuch a manner of death, or
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51388:63"/>
way of Trial agreeable enough to, and conſiſtent with all the obligations here ſpoken of, even the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it ſelf:</hi> as to which, ſays <hi>Price</hi> in his <hi>Clerico-Claſſicum,</hi> p. 27, 28. <hi>We were bound to preſerve and defend the Kings perſon, when we firſt took this Covenant, and at that time you</hi> (Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Miniſters of <hi>London) know very well you ſtirred up the people to fight againſt</hi> his Army, <hi>though</hi> his perſon <hi>was the leader thereof; which preſumes either, 1. That you perſwaded the people againſt the dictates of your own Conſciences; or, 2. That you conceived, that though his Perſon ſhould be ſmitten into the chambers of Death, by thoſe that aid fight againſt his Army, yet they did not break the Covenant. If ſo, then there is a caſe wherein the King's Perſon may be cut off without breach of Covenant.</hi>] Thus he, and appoſitely enough, and therefore I ſay again, <hi>Let prudent men weigh things in the balance of Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author goes on and asks, <hi>Is there any thing in the nature of Prelacy that frames the mind to obedience and loyalty? or is there any thing in the nature of Presbytery that enclines to rebellion and diſobedience—?</hi> A. If he means by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Prelacy the principles of Prelatical Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and by the nature of Presbytery the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Presbyterians, I maintain the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in both Queſtions, and ſuppoſe I have already abundantly evinc'd it, as to Presbyterians both Scotch and Engliſh; and as for Prelatical Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, if this Author or any body elſe can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any ſuch enormous and ſeditious principles
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51388:64"/>
out of their Writings, as I have here quoted out of Presbyterian Authors, let thoſe writings, by my conſent, and together with them Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi>'s <hi>Soveraign Power of Parliaments,</hi> (by which word [<hi>Parliaments</hi>] he means the two Houſes, without and againſt the King) undergo the ſame Fate with <hi>David Pareus</hi> his Commentary, and the Presbyterian League and Covenant; and if any of their practiſes have been ſuitable, let thoſe mens perſons alſo have the odious character of Rebellion and Diſobedience affixt unto them. But that any ſuch Prelatical Proteſtant can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, is more than I know or have any reaſon to believe. Certain I am, that Engliſh proteſtant Prelatiſts profeſs their aſſent to, and practically own thoſe principles mentioned, <hi>p.</hi> 24, 25. Which Principles do in their own nature, and where they are cordially enbraced, frame the minds of Engliſh Subjects to obedience and loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore let this Author prove, if he can, that <hi>ſince a Proteſtant Prelacy was erected among us,</hi> our Kings have had any ſuch tedious conflicts with Prelates, as he ſays they had in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, and for a ſeries of many Ages. As for <hi>the Popes Prelates,</hi> they are ſo near of kin to <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that 'tis no great wonder if they create trouble to Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Presbytery and Rebellion be conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, how comes it to paſs that thoſe States or Kingdoms where it hath been eſtabliſht or tolerated, have for any time been free from broils and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi>] One would think there were a ſufficient
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51388:64"/>
anſwer comprehended in the words of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For thoſe Presbyterians are rebellious with a witneſs, that will embroil even thoſe States and Kingdoms where their Form of Worſhip and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is either eſtabliſht or tolerated; and yet <hi>the French Proteſtants</hi> are abuſed by a late Reflecter on the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, if notwithſtanding this they are not too prone to Rebellion, <hi>and that on account of their Principles. What an exception,</hi> ſays he (p. 42. of his Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>terrible to Princes, the French Calviniſtical Church hath made in their Confeſſion of Faith, speaking of obedience due to the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, appears at leaſt every Sunday in all their hands in Print, where they acknowledge ſuch Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to them, except the Law of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be intereſſed (on condition that Gods Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty remain undiminiſh'd;) which clauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>what it means, their ſo many and ſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Rebellions do expound.</hi>] What turbulent things Scotch and Engliſh presbyterians have been, thoſe very practiſes of theirs, which theſe ſheets have mentioned (to which many more might be added) are a competent Teſtimony. But this <hi>Quaere</hi> ſhall not ſcape ſo, let's view it again. [<hi>If Presbytery and Rebellion be connatural, how comes it to paſs that thoſe States or Kingdoms where it hath been eſtabliſht or tolerated, have for any time been free from broils and commotions?</hi>] A. 1. It may be 'twas becauſe though their minds were always enclined (by their principles) to rebellion, yet they had not power and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51388:65"/>
to act ſuitably to thoſe inclinations, with hopes of ſucceſs. 'Twere a ſad thing indeed, if Rebels ſhould be able at all times to put their traiterous Deſigns in execution. 2. It ſuffices (in reference to the grand Queſtion now diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) if Presbyterian ſpirits are prone to Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in caſe their way of Worſhip <hi>be not either eſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht or tolerated.</hi> For they deſerve not to be ſo much as tolerated in any Kingdom, that will, when they have power, rebel againſt Kings, if they be not tolerated. 3. If this <hi>Quaere</hi> implies any good proof, that Presbytery and Rebellion is not connatural (by which he means, I ſuppoſe, not uſually conjoyn'd) it does as ſtrongly imply, that Jeſuitiſm and Rebellion are not connatural, ſince thoſe States and Kingdoms where Jeſuits have been tolerated, have for ſome time been free from broils and commotions. It follows:</p>
            <p>[<hi>Or how comes it to paſs that Presbyterians have never diſclaimed or abandoned their lawful Prince?</hi>] As if (to let paſs other Inſtances) Engliſh Presbyterians did not diſclaim and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the late King, <hi>when they denied him to be in a condition to Govern,</hi> (H. of Comm. Decl. 28. <hi>Nov. 1646.) when they denied him the exerciſe of that power in the Militia, which themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged did belong unto him:</hi> (Veritas incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſa, <hi>p. 147. 168.) When they affirmed that the Soveraign power reſided in both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that the King had no Negative voice; that whatſoever the two Houſes ſhould Vote, was not by Law to be queſtioned, either by the King or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51388:65"/>
that it belonged to them only to judge of the Law. (Declar. of May</hi> 26. 1642.) as if like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they did not make others to diſclaim and abandon him, by making them ſwear that <hi>they would neither directly nor indirectly adhere unto or willingly aſſiſt the King in his War and Cauſe.</hi> But he proceeds.</p>
            <p>[<hi>How comes it to paſs that they have never ceaſed to ſolicit and ſupplicate his regards and favour? even when their power hath been at the higheſt, and his ſunk loweſt?</hi>] Whereas I read in <hi>Philips</hi> his <hi>Veritas inconcuſſa</hi> (his Book that proves K. <hi>Charles</hi> 1. no man of bloud) theſe words, <hi>p. 124. Indſtead of offering any thing which was like to bring peace, they</hi> (the Presbyterian Lords and Commons) <hi>cauſed men and women in the firſt year of their war to be killed, becauſe they did but petition them to accept of a peace: And in the third and fourth year of their war plundered and robbed them that petitioned them but to hearken to it: And put out of Office and made all as Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents in the ſeventh year of their war that did but petition them for a Treaty with the King, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed all the Kings many, very many meſſages for peace, not only when he was at the higheſt of his ſucceſs in the war, but when he was at the loweſt, and a priſoner to them, and conjured them as they would anſwer it at the dreadful day of judgment to pity the bleeding condition of his Kingdomes and People, and ſend propoſitions of peace unto him; and years and half-years, and more than a whole year together after the battel at</hi> Naſeby (<hi>inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51388:66"/>
as their fellow-Rebels the Scotch Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did heavily complain of it) were at ſeveral times trifled away and spent before any propoſitions could be made ready.</hi> Was this perpetually to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their lawful Princes regards and favour? And <hi>p. 126. We are told they were ſo unwilling to have any peace at all, as that 6 or 7 Meſſengers or Trumpeters could come from the King before they could be at leiſure, or ſo mannerly as to anſwer one of them: but this or that meſſage from the King was received and read, and laid by till a week or when they would after.</hi> And <hi>p. 128, 129. When they did treat they deſired the granting of ſuch propoſitions as were purpoſely contrived and ſtood upon to hinder a peace; and were not to be asked or granted by any that could but entitle themſelves to the leaſt part of reaſon or humanity,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>p. 68. The King complains that although he had uſed all ways and means to prevent the diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and dangers of the Kingdom, all his labours had been fruitleſs, that not ſo much as a Treaty earneſtly deſired by him, could be obtained (though he diſclaimed all his Proclamations and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Erecting of his Standard as againſt his Parliament) unleſs he ſhould denude himſelf of all force to defend him from a viſible ſtrength marching againſt him. And when the buſineſs of the Treaty</hi> (1647 as I ſuppoſe) <hi>came into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the Aſſembly of Divines quickly reſolved (all of them but four) to be againſt it.</hi> (See conſiderations touching the preſent Factions in the King's Dominions, <hi>p.</hi> 6.) And yet this Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen-face
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51388:66"/>
would perſwade us that Presbyterians never ceaſed to ſolicit and ſupplicate the Kings regards and favour. It ſeems their voting (1647) <hi>that they would receive no more meſſages from the King, and that no man ſhould preſume to bring any from him, and that they would make no farther applications and addreſſes to him,</hi> was ſo far from being a diſclaiming and abandoning him, that 'twas not ſo much as a ceaſing to ſupplicate his regards and favour (<hi>statuimus i. e. abrogamus</hi>) what ſhall be done unto thee, O thou falſe Tongue and ridiculous Flatterer? The other part of his Quaere is, [<hi>How comes it to paſs that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians ſuffered themſelves rather to be trodden under foot, than to comply with men of violence in changing the Government?</hi>] A. 1. 'Twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were unable to make their parts good againſt thoſe men of violence (here intended.) Independents had cheated them out of that power which before they had. 2. Themſelves were <hi>the men of violence</hi> that did firſt of all really change the Government by acting without and fighting againſt the Kings Perſon and Authority. Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents took away <hi>the name [King</hi>] but Presbyterians had long before deſtroyed <hi>the [thing.</hi>] 3. 'Twere no great wonder if Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians ſuffered themſelves to be trodden under foot (when they could not help it) rather than comply with thoſe that would not advance the Presbyterian Intereſt; but what's this to the objection <hi>of Rebellion and Diſobedience?</hi> Does it follow that <hi>they did not rebel againſt the King</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:51388:67"/>
becauſe <hi>they ſuffered themſelves to be trodden under foot</hi> by Independents? but 4. 'Tis ſomewhat hard to underſtand what Presbyterians mean when they ſay they ſuffered themſelves <hi>to be trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot.</hi> None can properly be ſaid to ſuffer themſelves to be ill uſed, but thoſe that are able to repel that ill uſage if they pleaſe, which Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians being not able to do when Independents had the power of the ſword, they are very fond ſelf-flatterers thus to apologize for themſelves, which I ſpeak only on ſuppoſition that they were ill uſed and trodden under foot, but that there is any Truth in that ſuppoſition (thus indefinitely expreſt) is more than I believe, unleſs they imagined themſelves trodden under foot and ill uſed becauſe they were not ſuffered to domineer over and ſtill to rule the whole Nation as they liſted; as if all men were trodden under foot or caſt out on the Dunghill (like unſavoury ſalt) that are not ſuffered to ſit in the Throne and uſurp the Scepter of Majeſty. For what elſe were Presbyterians deprived of when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was changed? Did they not ſtill enjoy <hi>their lives</hi> and (in a far higher degree than Loyal Subjects) <hi>their Liberties? their Lands</hi> alſo and <hi>livings,</hi> and <hi>their Sacrilegious Purchaſes?</hi> and beſides all this were not Lay-Presbyterians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in and advanced to Civil offices and places of Truſt: and were not other Presbyterians Maſters of Colledges and Halls in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and continued in their Fellowſhips there? as likewiſe Presbyterian Parſons in their fat Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51388:67"/>
in City and Countrey? and had they not the liberty to exerciſe whatſoever ſpiritual power they pleaſed to claim and vindicate to themſelves over their Pariſhioners? Whence I conclude, that the meaning of thoſe words muſt (as to the generality of Presbyterians) be this: They ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves <hi>to be trodden under foot,</hi> that is, <hi>to live, to be kept out of priſon, to reap the profits of the Lands in their poſſeſſions, whether well or ill gotten, whether by the robbing of God and his Church of their ſacred Revenues, or others of that which legally belonged unto them; to be Mayors, Bailiffs, Sheriffs, Juſtices of the Peace, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, &amp;c.</hi> And the Presbyterian Miniſters in the Univerſity, City, and Countrey ſuffered themſelves <hi>to be trodden under foot,</hi> that is, <hi>to be continued in thoſe Headſhips, Fellowſhips, Parſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, Rectories, Cures, which by Law belonged unto, and were illegally, unrighteouſly plundered from other men; and to enjoy the liberty of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating (in their reſpective Pariſhes) whom they pleaſed, and excluding as many as they pleaſed from the priviledge of both Sacraments.</hi> But ſure if Royaliſts had been ſo favourably uſed by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians as Presbyterians were by Independents, they would never have been ſo ingratefully and nonſenſically querulous, as to ſay they were trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot.] In a Pamphlet printed 1648. called [The Pulpit-Incendiary] and directed againſt Mr. <hi>Calamy,—Caſe,—Cawton,—Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>—and other <hi>Sion-Colledge</hi>-Preachers, there are theſe words, <hi>p. 45. You complain of your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,

bondage and ſlavery, of oppreſſions, ſorrows and troubles of the Church, that is doubtleſs of the Church Presbyterian, and no other. What doth ail you? what troubles you? who doth oppreſs you? Have you not Authority on your ſide? have you not all the Church-livings in the Kingdom? have you not Declaration upon Declaration, Ordinance upon Ordinance, Order upon Order, for to back you? Is there the leaſt ſhew of oppreſſion, ſorrow or cauſe of complaint adminiſtred unto you, except it be becauſe you are not ſuffered to oppreſs, vex and gall your Brethren that joyn not with you? Can you feed upon nothing but bloud? yea the bloud of your Brethren? that though you have every thing elſe, (that only prohibited) you complain of ſorrow, ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, oppreſſion? Is this your ſlavery and captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that you cannot enſlave and lead into captivity? Is this to kill you with the ſword, that you cannot kill your Brethren with the ſword?</hi> I add, Is this for Presbyterians to be trodden under foot, that they cannot tread others under foot? Beſides, this Author hath before intimated (p. 45, 55.) that the generality of Presbyterians did at laſt comply with the men of violence in their changing the Government; for they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed that Engagement which was deſigned for the defending and maintaining of that change: The great, if not only motive whereunto in all probability was, that they might ſtill keep poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their Livings and livelihoods, and not be outlawed: and yet here he would perſwade us, that Presbyterians (indefinitely) ſuffered
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51388:68"/>
themſelves to be trodden under foot, rather than they would comply with thoſe men of violence. So true is that ſaying, <hi>Oportet mend—eſſe mem—Some</hi> (as he tells us in that <hi>p.</hi> if we may believe him) <hi>utterly refuſed even to the forfeiture of their Preferments, and the hazard of their Livelihoods.</hi>—Notwithſtanding which words, 1. There were but ſome only that ſo refuſed.—2. Thoſe very ſome might afterwards engage, rather than the forfeiture (occaſioned by their refuſal at firſt) ſhould be taken, or their livelihoods loſt as well as hazarded. I have heard indeed of one Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Doctor, who rather than he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Engagement publickly at <hi>Oxford,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Headſhip of about 80. <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> but yet the ſame man was ſo providently politick, as to ſubſcribe in the Countrey rather than ſuffer himſelf to be trodden under foot, that is, to have a Living of ſix or ſeven hundred a year taken from him: and it may be there were a few more Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians (<hi>that had Pluralities</hi>) who acted in like manner. But this is no Apology for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Presbyterians, who did not ſo much as <hi>hazard</hi> their livelihoods, or render themſelves liable to be trodden under foot, by refuſing to comply. And as for thoſe eminent Presbyterian Miniſters and others, (ſpoken of in the ſame <hi>p.</hi>) who either hazarded or loſt their lives in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining to bring our Soveraign, that now is, to the rightful poſſeſſion of this Kingdom; it cannot reaſouably be ſaid, that ſuch men ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be trodden under foot, ſince by thoſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51388:69"/>
combining attempts they oppoſed and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ruine and deſtroy thoſe men of violence that trod them under foot. Nor can they proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or juſtly be ſaid to ſuffer themſelves to be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot, who do not ſuffer it meekly and patiently, without railing at or reviling thoſe that tread them under. Whereas if the carriage of Presbyterian Miniſters generally was like that which is reported of the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> in 1648. (when they ſuppoſed that the men of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence were about to change the Government) they made it their buſineſs to inveigh againſt thoſe men of violence in ſharp and bitter lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. For the Author of the Pulpit-Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tells us, that [<hi>the London-Miniſters (were ſo far from ſuffering themſelves humbly, peaceably, and patiently to be trodden under foot, that their) Tongues were ſharpned like Serpents, Adders poyſon was under their Lips, ſtinging and poyſoning the name and repute of the Army,</hi> p. 16. <hi>calling them a Rebellious Army, a generation of Vipers, a Viperous brood, &amp;c. And that on Sabbath-days and Faſt-days in Preaching and Praying they ſtill girded at the Parliament</hi> (viz. <hi>the Independent majority) as men that declined their Solemn League and Covenant, hindred reformation, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but their own Intereſt.</hi> He tells us alſo, p. 14. <hi>That the morning Lectures which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Ark of God in their frequent removals moneth after moneth, from place to place, were ſo modelled and conſtituted, that in them a lamentable ſlaughter was made of the ſweet affections of love,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51388:69"/>
kindneſs, gentleneſs, goodneſs, patience each to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward other,</hi> p. 2. <hi>That that Ark of theirs ſeems frequently to be drawn—by Bulls of</hi> Baſan,—<hi>toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and goring the Parliament, and Army, and their diſſenting Brethren, from day to day, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fomenting contentions, ſtrifes and diviſions,</hi> p. 3. <hi>That the</hi> London-<hi>Miniſters did by conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Counſels, and debates in</hi> Sion-Colledge (London's, <hi>nay,</hi> England's <hi>diſtemper) conceive ſinful reſolution to engage and tamper privately with chief Citizens in publick places, as Common-Council-men, &amp;c. and publickly in Pulpit and Preſs ſtirring up the people by all poſſible means, under the pretence of the glory of God, a bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the keeping of the Covenant, &amp;c. to ſet all together by the ears—and raiſe a new War,</hi> p. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>From which premiſes, I may, for ought I ſee, well enough conclude, that this Author inſtead of pretending that Presbyterians ſuffered themſelves rather to be trodden under foot, than to comply with men of violence in changing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould (in Truth and Juſtice) have thus repreſented them—That rather than they would comply with the men of violence, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed they were about to change the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they endeavoured to prevent the being trodden under foot by them, by imbittering mens ſpirits againſt them in their preachments and direful Prayers, by ſowing the ſeeds of contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diviſion, and by inflaming mens minds to take Arms, reſiſt and deſtroy them—and when
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51388:70"/>
notwithſtanding all ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, Independents had effected the change of thoſe ſmall remains and parcels of the Engliſh Government, which Presbyterian violence had left unchanged, that Party generally did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſo far comply, even with that change alſo, that rather than they would be trodden under foot, outlawed and ſequeſtred, they engaged to be faithful to the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> as then eſtabliſht by the men of violence, without King or Houſe of Lords; it ſeems they who thus act are ſaid (<hi>in the Presbyterian dialect</hi>) to ſuffer themſelves to be trodden under foot. And now judge whether <hi>statuimus</hi> muſt not here again ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>abrogamus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us (as our Author proceeds) further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. <hi>Are the perſons that adhere to Prelacy more conſcientious in duty to God and Man, than thoſe that affect Presbytery? Are the former only ſober, juſt, and godly, and the latter vicious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, profane?</hi>] A. Though I could ſpeak ſomething to theſe Queſtions from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, having lived both in Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Families and places, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with divers Perſons, Miniſters, and others of both perſwaſions, yet becauſe compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this kind are odious, I ſhall anſwer only in reference to the main thing in Queſtion, that [<hi>there's more reaſon of State] for the pro ecting a drunken Royaliſt than a ſober Rebel, and yet I am fully perſwaded, that neither of them ſo remaining have holineſs enough in this world to render them
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51388:70"/>
capable of happineſs in the next.</hi> Nor do I doubt, but it may be as much the lot of ſome Traiterous ſpirits to be ſober, as 'tis (if this Author tell truth in the following lines) of ſome that adhere to Prelacy to be loyal; but whether I have not already ſaid enough to prove, that Presbyterian principles encline to Rebellion, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Engliſh prelatiſts to Loyalty, let all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Readers judge. If this be not anſwer ſufficient to thoſe <hi>Quaeries,</hi> I ſhall ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it with tranſcribing (for this Authors ſake) a paſſage or two out of the writings of his fellow-Rebels. The firſt ſhall be out of <hi>William Sedgwick</hi>'s [Leaves of the Tree of Life for the healing of the Nations, <hi>p. 36.] Of the two 'tis more ſtrange to ſee that the Presbyterian, who the other day was oppreſt by the Biſhop for his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in point of the Sabbath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who could not (long ſince) live without the favour of the Biſhop, ſhould now thruſt out thoſe under whom he lived for not taking the Covenant, which is contrary to their conſcience; and ſhew leſs favour to them than he received from them, and do that which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in others; and this upon weak and fleſhly grounds, admiring his own way, which is to pray and preach longer and more than another, to be ſtrict in repetition on Sabbath-days, and ſome ſuch poor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal things; to ſet up this as the power of Godlineſs and Reformation, to the ruine of another, who it may be is a man of more juſtice, ability and wiſdom, more ſobriety, more ſtability, more patience and conſtancy in ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:51388:71"/>The other ſhall be out of <hi>J.

            </p>
            <p>To theſe I ſhall add ſome paſſages of the like import out of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> in his [<hi>Mortification
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51388:71"/>
of Sin in Believers] p. 29. There is indeed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a broad light fallen upon the men of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and together therewith many ſpiritual gifts communicated, which with ſome other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations have wonderfully enlarged the bounds of Profeſſors and Profeſſion—Hence there is a noiſe of Religion and Religious duties in every Corner preaching in abundance; and that not in an empty, light, trivial, and vain manner as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, but to a good proportion of a ſpiritual Gift; ſo that if you will meaſure the number of Believers by light, gifts and profeſſion, the Church may have cauſe to ſay, who hath born me all theſe? But now if you will take the meaſure of them by this great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating Grace of Chriſtians, perhaps you will find their number not ſo multiplyed: Where almoſt is that Profeſſor who ows his converſion to theſe days of Light, and ſo talks and profeſſes at ſuch a rate of ſpirituality as few in former days were in any meaſure acquainted with—that doth not give evidence of a miſerably unmortified heart? If vain ſpending of time, talents, unprofitableneſs in mens places, envy, ſtrife, variance, emulations, wrath, pride, worldlineſs, ſelfiſhneſs be badges of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, we have them on us and among us in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi> The ſame Dr. in his Book of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>p.</hi> 64. asks this Queſtion, <hi>would any one have thought it poſſible that ſuch and ſuch profeſſors in our days ſhould have fallen into ways of ſelf, of fleſh, of the World; to play at cards, Dice, revel, dance, to neglect family, cloſet duties, to be proud, haughty, ambitious, worldly, covetous, oppreſſive?
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51388:72"/>
or that they ſhould be turned away after fooliſh, vain, ridiculous opinions, deſerting the Goſpel of Chriſt? in which two lies the great temptation that is come on us the inhabitants of this world to try us. But doth not every man ſee that this is come to paſs? and may we not ſee how it is come to paſs? Some looſe empty Profeſſors that had never more than a Form of Godlineſs when they had ſerved their turn of that began the way to them; then others began a little to comply, and to pleaſe the fleſh in ſo doing; this by little and little hath reached even the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boughs and branches of our profeſſion, until almoſt all fleſh hath corrupted its ways, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from theſe iniquities makes his name a prey if not his perſon. And p. 55, 56. How full is the world of ſpecious pretences and pleadings? as—the liberty and freedom of Chriſtians delivered from a bondage-frame—This is a door that in my own obſervation I have ſeen ſundry go out at into ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality and Apoſtaſie, beginning at a light converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeding to a neglect of the Sabbath, publick and private duties, ending in diſſoluteneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, and then there is leaving off publick things to providence—Theſe and the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations joyned with the eaſe and plenty, the greatneſs and promotion of profeſſors have ſo brought things about, that whereas we have</hi> by providence ſhifted places with the men of the world, <hi>we have</hi> by ſin ſhifted ſpirits with them alſo; <hi>we are like a plantation of men carried into a forreign Countrey, in a ſhort ſpace they degenerate from the manners of the people from whence they came,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51388:72"/>
and fall into thoſe of the countrey whereinto they are brought; as if there were ſomething in the Soil and the Air that transformed them. Give me leave a little to follow my ſimilitude: He that ſhould ſee the prevailing Party of theſe Nations, many of thoſe in rule, power, favour, with all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, and remember that they were a Colony of Puritans, whoſe habitation was in a low place, as the Prophet ſpeaks of the City of God, tranſlated by an high hand to the mountains they now poſſeſs; cannot but wonder how ſoon they have forgot the cuſtomes, manners, ways of their own old people, and are caſt into the mould of them that went before them in the places whereunto they are tranſlated. I speak of us all, eſpecially of us who are among the loweſt of the people, where perhaps this iniquity doth moſt abound, what were thoſe before us that we are not? what did they which we do not? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity hath ſlain the fooliſh and wounded the wiſe.</hi> Thus the (then) Dean of Chriſt-Church.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:51388:73"/>If all this be true, then Engliſh Presbyterians have not faithfully received and kept Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Principles; for I am ſure they have not been good Subjects becauſe Traytors and Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Soveraign Lord: and therefore I ſhall make bold to conclude from this Author's premiſſes, that they have been neither good Chriſtians nor good men: I am ſure they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured the King, for as his Majeſty complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Declaration concerning Levyes, <hi>his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was deſpiſed by them and as much as in them lay taken from him; and reviled in Pulpits and Preſſes by Perſons immediately under their protection, and of their recommendation.</hi> And the <hi>London</hi>-Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (if <hi>John Price</hi> ſpeak truth in his <hi>Clerico-Claſſicum, p.</hi> 53.) told the people that <hi>the King was a man of bloud; and took hold of all whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, hearſays and probabilities of his wickedneſs to make him odious to the people:</hi> And therefore by this <hi>John Corbet</hi>'s good leave, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they had not then learn'd <hi>to fear God.</hi> That they were a Law to themſelves I eaſily grant, but 'twas juſt as Traytors and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors uſe to be, who trample under foot the righteous Laws of a Nation, becauſe inconſiſtent with their rebellious, ambitious, and ungodly deſigns; and are reſolved to follow the Law of their own wills; and in this Presbyterians were patterns to many others, and conſequently a main help to the Independents in their deſtroying thoſe remnants of the Civil Government of this Nation which themſelves had (<hi>for want of time to finiſh
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51388:73"/>
their miſchievous enterprizes</hi>) left undemoliſhed. But this Egregious Paraſite has not done yet; for he would fain delude his Reader with another Apologetick in behalf of his Party. [<hi>Whoſoever they be that teach blind obedience, Presbyterians teach Faith and Holineſs; as alſo Obedience active in all lawful things, and paſſive in things unlawful enjoyned by the higher Power.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I do not underſtand or believe that there is any ſuch diametral oppoſition between <hi>blind obedience</hi> on one hand and <hi>faith and holineſs</hi> on the other, but that the ſame Perſons, Presbyterians as well as Jeſuits may teach both. I rather believe that blind obedience in matters preſcribed by and agreeable to the word of God, will ſooner bring a man to heaven than all that Faith and Holineſs which too many Modern presbyterian Boutefeaus have taught either by their Doctrine or Practice. But the latter clauſe [<hi>that they teach obedience active in all lawful things, and paſſive in things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful enjoyned by the higher power</hi>] may juſtly make an impartial Reader that reflects upon their actions for ſeveral years together to wonder what this man means by [<hi>the higher power</hi>] by [<hi>things unlawful</hi>] by [<hi>obedience active and paſſive.</hi>] If in the days of the Long Parliament, Presbyterian Doctrines and practices in this point were ſuitable and correſpondent, the words muſt be thus paraphraſad: Presbyterians taught obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience active in things unlawful enjoyned by the two Houſes (whom Mr. <hi>Herle</hi>'s (as 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) ſeditious invention made (only) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51388:74"/>
with the King) and diſobedience active even to bloudy Rebellion in things lawful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the King, whom by Oath they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the only Supreme Governour of this Kingdom. I have read in <hi>Philips</hi> his <hi>Veritas inconcuſſa, p.</hi> 23. that (in 1642) <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Pulpits flamed with ſeditious invectives againſt the King, and incitements to Rebellion, and that the people running headlong into it had all manner of countenance and encouragement, but thoſe Miniſters that preacht obedience and ſought to prevent Rebellion, were ſure to be impriſoned and put out of their places for it.</hi>] Was this for Presbyterians to preach either Faith or Holineſs, or Obedience active to the King? or were thoſe men ſo good Subjects, ſo good Chriſtians, as either actively or paſſively to obey his Majeſty, or preach ſuch obedience, when they took them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and exhorted others to take that Solemn League and Covenant, which the King in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt it calls a Traiterous and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous combination againſt himſelf and the eſtabliſht Religion and Laws of the Kingdom? [<hi>We do therefore,</hi> ſays his Majeſty, <hi>ſtrictly charge and command all our loving Subjects of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or quality ſoever, upon their Allegiance, that they preſume not to take the ſaid ſeditious and traiterous Covenant. And we do likewiſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forbid and inhibit all our Subjects to impoſe, adminiſter or tender the ſaid Covenant, as they and every of them will anſwer the contrary at their utmoſt and extremeſt peril.</hi>]
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51388:74"/>
What therefore was the taking of this Covenant and tendering of it to others? was it obedience? either active, or paſſive, to the King? No, but on the contrary, 'twas active diſobedience to his Majeſties command; and the taking up Arms againſt the King in proſecution of this Covenant thus taken, and curſing thoſe that did not, was Treaſon and Rebellion by the Lawes of the Land, and damnable reſiſtance by the Law of Chriſt. And theſe and other Presbyterian pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices were ſuch a palpable contradiction to the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, that in ſome late reflexions on thoſe Oaths, 'tis admired with what face presbyterians can now either take or urge them. <hi>It's a wonderful myſtery,</hi> p. 41. <hi>how it ſhould come to paſs, that our Engliſh Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp;c. ſhould (eſpecially now of late) with ſo much willingneſs and greedineſs themſelves ſwallow theſe Oaths, and ſo clamorouſly urge them on others. Is it becauſe the Oath of Supremacy has ſo peculiar a conformity to their principles, and that of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to their practices? or that they are ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and preſſing to diſclaim and condemn all, that themſelves have done theſe laſt twenty years?</hi>—And a little after: <hi>Who ever heard or knew to flow from the Tongue, or drop from the Pen of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, ſo Chriſtian a Poſition as is ſincerely avouched both by Engliſh Proteſtants and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body of</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks,</hi> viz. <hi>that even in caſe a Chriſtian or Heathen Prince ſhould make uſe of his Civil Power to perſecute Truth, that power ought not upon any pretences to be actively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51388:75"/>
by violence or force of Arms, but though they cannot approve, they muſt at leaſt patiently ſuffer the effects of his miſ-uſed Authority, leaving the judgment to God only?</hi> If this Rector can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this Queſtion in the affirmative, and then prove it true of any one Covenanting Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Scotch or Engliſh, within the compaſs of this laſt twenty years, let him, I ſhall be glad to ſee it. Whether he can do ſo much or no I doubt, (as I do likewiſe, whether that Reflecter can prove that that Poſition, as he has worded it, is owned by <hi>the general body of</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks;</hi>) but that he cannot do it of Presbyterians general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or any conſiderable number of them, I am pretty well aſſured: if he can, 'twill follow that the generality of Presbyterians, or a conſiderable number of them moſt wretchedly detained that Truth in unrighteouſneſs, and for ſeveral years together acted moſt horrid things contrary to their Light, Knowledge and Conſcience. But 'tis obſervable, that this crafty Impoſtor inſtead of [<hi>proving</hi>] that Presbyterians teach obedience active in things lawful, and paſſive in things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful enjoyned <hi>by [the King's Majeſty] [af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms only</hi>] that they teach ſuch obedience in things enjoyned by the [<hi>Higher power</hi>] not tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, whether they mean the higher power <hi>de jure, or de facto only;</hi> nor whether their Doctrine will not comprehend the higher power <hi>de facto,</hi> though themſelves acknowledge it no power <hi>de jure,</hi> if ſo be that power will in the main comply with the advancement of the Presbyterian Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.

What the presbyterians meant by <hi>the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power</hi> in the late diviſions, was too evident by their practiſes, <hi>viz. that parcel minor, part of the Long Parliament which favoured Presbytery, which oppoſed the King and made War againſt him, which elected a multitude of new Members, by vertue of a counterfeit (treaſonable) Seal.

God and honour the King, as to be able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſtinguiſh between the ſupreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and the ſupreme Power of this Nation, (Sover. power of Parl. <hi>p.</hi> 104.) and to teach, that <hi>the King was indeed the Supreme Governour, but the Parliament</hi> (by which he underſtood thoſe two Houſes) <hi>was the Supreme Power: (which is very strange,</hi> ſays Judge <hi>Jenkins, for who can govern without power?</hi> p. 57.) Whence all that I ſhall conclude is, 1. That this part of the Authors Apology is rather an implicit confeſſion and proof of the crime objected than an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Presbyterian Innocence. And 2. That it concerns his Majeſty, before he reſolve to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and encourage Presbyterians, to catechize them very particularly and ſtrictly, touching thoſe Loyal principles which this <hi>J. C.</hi> pretends to be embraced by them, that ſo it may appear, whether when they take the Oath of Supremacy, they do it not with that Jeſuitical, or more than Jeſuitical Equivocation juſt now mentioned, or with ſuch a mental reſervation, as will infer their approving (now as well as in the late Wars) of that Treaſonable diſtinction between the King's perſonal and politick capacity, and that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and damned opinion (as it ſeems <hi>Cook</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports call it, <hi>B.</hi> 7. in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe) <hi>that Homage and the Oath of Allegiance, was more by reaſon of the Kings Crown, his Politick capacity, than by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Perſon of the King:</hi> whence they infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe deteſtable conſequences: 1. If the King demean not himſelf by reaſon, his Leiges are
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51388:76"/>
bound by Oath to remove him. 2. Seeing the King could not be reformed by Suit at Law, that it ought to be done <hi>per aſpertè,</hi> by force. 3. That his Leiges are bound to govern in aid of him: all which were condemned by two Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, one in the reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and the other 1 <hi>Edw. 3. ch.</hi> 1. (See <hi>Sheringham</hi>'s Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the King's right, <hi>p.</hi> 75.) <hi>And yet all theſe three damnable, deteſtable and execrable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are the grounds whereupon the preſent time (of the late Wars) relies, and the principles whereupon the two Houſes found their cauſe,</hi> ſays J. <hi>Jenkins, p.</hi> 10. For ought I know Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians own theſe principles to this day, and ſo are prepared in mind again to teach men actively to diſobey the King, yea, and to dethrone his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, by acknowledging two ſuch Houſes (and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as) the Higher power, whenſoever they can by their diſturbing Arts and Influences (in raiſing and countenancing barbarous, and ſeditious Tumults) divide the King from the Houſes, the Loyal part of the Houſes from the Diſloyal, and then patch them up again by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Elections, and ſo pack together a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men, whom they will be bold enough to call a Parliament. If all Presbyterians are of the ſame belief with <hi>Zachary Crofton</hi> (in his <hi>Berith Anti-Baal</hi>) they are ſtill of opinion, <hi>That the Covenant-impoſing and taking Lords and Commons were a moſt lawful, rightly called, and conſtituted Aſſembly, the Princes and principal Rulers of the people,</hi> (though themſelves ſwear that the King
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51388:77"/>
is the only ſupreme Governour) (<hi>p. 7.) that they were the Princes, [yea more] the body of the people,</hi> p. 30. <hi>That their Oath</hi> (Covenant) <hi>was the moſt poſitive authentick repeal of any Laws obliging to the contrary,</hi> p. 31. 51. <hi>This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Mr.</hi> Crofton <hi>and all rational men do believe, That ſucceeding Parliaments are bound to repeal thoſe Laws which eſtabliſh the thing which thoſe Lords and Commons had ſworn to extirpate,</hi> p. 31. <hi>That their ſwearing thoſe things as the collective body of the Nation, binds all poſterity, who ſhall any way ſucceed into that national capacity.</hi> 'Tis no reaſon of State for the King (when he is able to ſuppreſs and reject them,) to protect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any Party of men thus principl'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd: and therefore reaſon of State will put his Majeſty upon a curious and diligent enquiry, whether Presbyterians and others retain theſe and the like principles, (<hi>as that the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is yet in being,</hi> which is favour'd alſo, <hi>p.</hi> 52.) and will oblige him to deny them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and encouragement, till they renounce and abjure all ſuch damnable and pernicious maxims.</p>
            <p>In the following Lines, <hi>p.</hi> 55-65. this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would fain perſwade us that Presbyterians muſt needs be good Subjects to a Chriſtian King, becauſe [<hi>Profaneneſs, intemperance, revellings, outrages, and filthy lewdneſs were not at any time in the memory of the preſent Age held under more reſtraint than in the late diſtracted times; the ſpecial reaſon whereof was becauſe a practical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51388:77"/>
was more thick ſet throughout the Nation, and the places where Presbyterian Miniſters had the greateſt influence were moſt reformed and civilized, and the orderly walking of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons did keep others more within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Which is no better than <hi>non cauſa pro cauſâ,</hi> for 'tis evident enough that that (ſuppoſed) effect muſt be attributed to Presbyterian <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> not Sermons, and (the Executors of them) Presbyterian Magiſtrates, (I mean Mayors, Bayliffs, Juſtices of the peace, Conſtables, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally choſen) as the ſpecial principal cauſe, without whoſe coercive power presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters might have preacht their hearts out before they had wrought the Reformation here talkt of, eſpecially conſidering 1. That himſelf <hi>p.</hi> 65. pleads for <hi>the annexing of ſome temporal damage and penalty to Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction; becauſe ſpiritual cenſures</hi> (and then ſay I much more Sermons) <hi>pertaining only to the Conſcience may be too little regarded.</hi> And 2. That 'twas eaſy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for many filthy, prophane, intemperate perſons thus to beſpeak many of thoſe practical Miniſters, (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did the Phariſaical Jew:) Behold thou art called a Presbyterian, and reſteſt in the Bible, and makeſt thy boaſt of God, and knoweſt his will, and approveſt the things that are excellent, being inſtructed out of the Law, and art confident that thou thy ſelf art a guide of the Blind, a light of them who are in darkneſs, an inſtructer of the fooliſh, a teacher of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51388:78"/>
Babes, who haſt the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Law: Thou therefore who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt another teacheſt thou not thy ſelf? Thou that preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou year after year reap the profits of that Living which by Law belongs to another, who was plundered of it by illegal violence? and that becauſe he was a more loyal Subject than thy ſelf? Thou that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreſt Idols, doſt thou juſtifie and approve of the committing Sacriledge? the robbing of God as well as man? Thou that gloryeſt in the Law (of the firſt Table at leaſt,) by breaking the Law (of the ſecond Table) diſhonoureſt thou God? Knoweſt thou not that he that ſaid, Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy Mother, Thou ſhalt not Kill nor Steal, nor bear falſe witneſs, nor covet other mens goods? Thou thundereſt out rebukes and threatneſt damnation againſt us that are Adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Fornicators, Unclean, Drunkards, Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and yet thou thy ſelf art notoriouſly guilty of thoſe (other) crimes which (together with theſe) are uſually and equally forbidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the ſame or the next verſe, and the doers of them ſentenc'd to Hell. When we lewd, prophane, and intemperate perſons read in the Old Teſtament that <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and ſtubbornneſs is as iniquity and Idolatry:</hi> And in the New Teſtament, that <hi>covetous Perſons, revilers, extortioners are in the number of thoſe unrighteous men that ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God:</hi> that they alſo who are guilty of <hi>idolatry,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51388:78"/>
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, ſtrife, fedition, murder, ſhall be excluded the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, as well as adulterers, fornicators, drunkards:</hi> and when 'tis evident to us from your practiſes, that you presbyterian Miniſters have for many years been (in a Scripture account) Wizards and Idolaters, becauſe you have beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your ſelves <hi>stubbornly and rebelliouſly</hi> againſt the command and Authority of God and the King, <hi>contentiouſly, wrathfully and ſeditiouſly</hi> againſt the inferiour Governours ſent by him as the ſupreme, that you have <hi>born falſe witneſs</hi> againſt thoſe that were loyal and obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as Traytors, Incendiaries, &amp;c. And then have manifeſted your ſelves ſo <hi>inſatiably covetous</hi> of their goods and legal poſſeſſions, that ſome of your party have enjoyed plundered goods, and ſequeſtred livings, legally belonging to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Royaliſts; and beſides all this you have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the proſperity of Presbyterian Armies, and encouraged them to fight againſt the King, and curſed thoſe that did not, and the more of the Kings Friends your forces killed, the more hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you gave thanks to God, and by ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving compliances are <hi>guilty of the bloud of thouſands of the Kings Loyal Subjects, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of ſo many murders.</hi> To kill any man in war without Authority derived from him or them that have legal power to make war, being <hi>murder;</hi> and that your Presbyterian Lords and Commons had no ſuch power (as to that war which they made and you abetted) is evident
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51388:79"/>
enough from this, that a Law of the Land, 25 <hi>Edw. 3. c.</hi> 2. makes it Treaſon to levy war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King in his Realm, or to be adherent to the Kings enemies in his Realm, giving them aid or comfort in the Realm or elſewhere: Since alſo 'tis no better than murder to kill or put thoſe men to death, whoſe lives (as well as goods, lands, &amp;c.) the Law hath taken ſpecial care to preſerve, you are by your approbation parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their ſin who murdered ſuch men. That you approved the taking away their lives who adhered to the King in the late wars, we preſume you will not deny (yea you covenanted to do them miſchief under the Notion of Malignants, Incendiaries, and Evil Inſtruments.) That the Law of the Land ſaves them harmleſs, is evident from 11 <hi>Henry 7. c.</hi> 1. Wherein 'tis declared <hi>to be againſt all Laws, Reaſon and good conſcience, that Subjects going with their Soveraign Lord in Wars, attending upon him in his perſon, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in other places by his commandment within this land or without, ſhould loſe or forfeit any thing for doing their duty or Service of Allegiance.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in likewiſe 'twas enacted, <hi>that no manner of perſon or perſons whatſoever—that attend upon the King and Soveraign Lord of this Land, for the time being, in his perſon, and do him true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice of Allegiance in the ſame, or be in other places by his commandment in his wars within this land or without, that for the ſaid deed and true duty of Allegiance, he or or they be in no wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict or attaint of high Treaſon, nor of other offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51388:79"/>
for that cauſe by Act of Parliament; or otherwiſe by any Proceſs of Law, whereby he or any of them ſhall loſe or forfeit life, lands, tenements, rents, poſſeſſions, hereditaments, goods, chattels or any other things, but to be for that deed and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice utterly diſcharged of any vexation, trouble or loſs: And if any Act or Acts, or other Proceſs of the Law hereafter thereupon for the ſame happen to be made contrary to this Ordinance, that then that Act or Acts or other Proceſs of Law what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſhall be, ſtand and be utterly void.</hi> Now you Presbyterian Preachers being thus guilty, with what face can you reprove our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, or judge us to Hell for thoſe vices which are but motes in compariſon of thoſe beams which an ordinary ſight may diſcern in your own eyes? and tell us if you can why theſe practices of yours do not give us juſt cauſe to ſuſpect that either <hi>you are very ſcandalouſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> of the moſt material and concerning portions of holy Scripture, or that <hi>you do not give any credit to them</hi> (and then why do you ſeek to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright us from our intemperateneſs and lewdneſs with ſuch <hi>mormo's</hi> as your ſelves are too ſturdy to be ſcar'd with?) or elſe that <hi>you have ſome Salvoes and comfortable reſerves</hi> which might keep us from deſpair, and make us preſume (upon Heaven) as well as your ſelves, if you would pleaſe to acquaint us with them? And therefore till your ſelves are more reformed and civilized, and walk more orderly towards God and the King, towards the Laws of Nature and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51388:80"/>
and this Nation, you cannot (in modeſty) expect that your Sermons ſhould prevail upon us to reſtrain our debauchery, or convert us from diſſoluteneſs and diſorder. And now let this Author prove if he can (as ſtrongly as he boldly affirms) that the men whom he pleads for (who are ſuch bad Chriſtians) muſt needs be good Subjects.</p>
            <p>But <hi>p.</hi> 56. The man goes on to prevaricate and abuſe his Readers into a good opinion of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Neither are they wandring ſtarrs, a people given to Change, fit to overturn and pull down but not to build up; they do not hang in the air, but build upon a firm ground; they have ſettled principles conſiſtent with the Rules of Stable Policy. Contrariwiſe Fanaticks (truly, and not abuſively ſo called) do build Caſtles in the Air, and are fit Inſtruments to diſturb and destroy and root out, but never to compoſe and plant and ſettle, for which cauſe their Kingdom could never hold long in any time or place of the World. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this ground Presbytery, not Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Anarchy hath been aſſaulted with greateſt violence by the more obſerving Prelatiſts; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this they have raiſed their main batteries: This appeared formidable, for 'tis stable and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and like to hold if once ſettled in good earneſt.</hi>]</p>
            <p>From which heap of words I gather, 1. That the Presbyterian Lords and Commons were Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks truly ſo called, ſince they manifeſted themſelves (for ſeveral years together) fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51388:80"/>
to diſturb and deſtroy, and root out the Order, Governours, and Government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht by Law; but when they had ſo far diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things, as to deſtroy by Force and Arms, that Form of Policy in Church and State; when they had done fighting againſt the King, and had gotten him into their clutches, inſtead of ſhewing their skill in compoſing, planting and ſetling, they employed their time in building Caſtles in the Air, till the Independent Fanaticks out-witted them, and cunningly jugled that power out of their hands which they had by force and violence wreſted from the hands of his Majeſty and the Laws.—2. I gather that the principles of the Anarchical ſectarians are more conſiſtent with the Rules of Stable-policy than thoſe of presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becauſe their Kingdom and Tyranny laſted much longer than that of Presbytery. 3. I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Prelatiſts had more reaſon to oppoſe Presbytery than ſectarian Anarchy, becauſe (if this Author be in this particular a tell-troth) presbytery was like to produce a more firm and rooted Schiſm againſt the Biſhops, and a more formidable, becauſe more durable rebellion againſt the King, than ſectarian Anarchy. 4. I conclude, that therefore we have great reaſon to bleſs God, that the Fanaticks routed the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, and put a period to the dominion of Presbytery, ſince, if it had once been ſetled in good earneſt, it would either have kept out his Majeſty much longer than ſectarian Anarchy did, or elſe have introduced him upon ſuch <hi>uncivil,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51388:81"/>
inſolent, and imperious terms,</hi> as the Scotch Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery brought him into that Nation, and would (in probability) have forced him to reſt content with an <hi>Iſle-of-Wight-titular-Kingſhip.</hi> But 5. I gather that Reaſon of State forbids the protecting and encouraging of Presbyterians, ſince they are not fit to overturn only, and pull down, but alſo to build up a ſtable and uniform Tower of Babel, in defiance to the Laws of God and the King; ſuch an one as 'twill concern Heaven it ſelf to take cognizance of, and to ſecure its own Soveraignty and Supremacy by exerting its wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, in defeating their Counſels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolling and confounding their ambitious deſigns. It follows:</p>
            <p>[<hi>This Party doth not run ſo faſt, but they know where to stop: they are a number of men ſo fixt and conſtant as none more; and a Prince or State ſhall know where to find them.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Whereas, 1. The Presbyterian Lords and Commons declared <hi>April</hi> 9. 1642. that <hi>they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take away nothing in the Government and Liturgie of the Church, but what ſhall be evil and juſtly offenſive, or at leaſt unneceſſary and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom;</hi> and yet afterwards they wholly extirpated the Government of our Church, and aboliſht its Liturgy: (things burdenſom, it ſeems, to them at laſt, though not juſtly offenſive:) and yet theſe men are ſo fixt and conſtant as none more. 2. His late Majeſty, in his Declaration occaſioned by the Presbyterian Ordinance, for aſſeſſing the Twentieth part of mens Eſtates, hath left on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51388:81"/>
ſome notable examples of that Parties fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conſiſtency with themſelves. <hi>We have not,</hi> ſays the King, <hi>lately heard of the old Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws, which uſed to warrant the Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This Ordinance needs a refuge even below thoſe Foundations. They will ſay they cannot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their undertakings without ſuch extraordinary ways; we think ſo too; but that proves only that they have undertaken ſomewhat, which they ought not to undertake; not that it's lawful for them to do any thing that is convenient for thoſe ends. We remembred them long ago, and we cannot do it too often, of that excellent ſpeech of Mr.</hi> Pym's, <hi>[The Law is that which puts a difference between good and evil; between juſt and unjuſt; if you take away the Law, all things will fall into a confuſion; every man will become a Law to himſelf: which in the depraved condition of humane Nature muſt needs produce many great enormities; Luſt will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Law; and Envy will become a Law; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and Ambition will become Laws; and what Dictates, what Deciſions ſuch Laws will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce may eaſily be diſcerned.] It may indeed,</hi> ſays his Majeſty, <hi>by the ſad inſtances over the whole Kingdom. But will poſterity believe, that in the ſame Parliament this Doctrine was avow'd with that Acclamation, and theſe Inſtances after produced? that in the ſame Parliament ſuch care was taken, that no man ſhould be committed in what caſe ſoever, without the cauſe of his Impriſonment expreſſed; and that all men ſhould be immediately bailed in all caſes bailable; and during the ſame
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51388:82"/>
Parliament that Alderman</hi> Pennington, <hi>or indeed any body elſe but the ſworn Miniſters of Juſtice, ſhould impriſon whom they would, and for what they would, and for as long time as they would? That the King ſhould be reproach'd for breach of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for accuſing of Sir</hi> John Hotham <hi>of High Treaſon, when with force of Arms he kept him out of</hi> Hull, <hi>and deſpiſed him to his Face,</hi> becauſe in no caſe a Member of either Houſe might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or accuſed without leave of that Houſe of which he is a Member; <hi>and yet that during the ſame Parliament the ſame Alderman ſhould commit the Earl of</hi> Middleſex (<hi>a Peer of the Realm) the Lord</hi> Buckhurſt (<hi>a Member of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) to the</hi> Counter <hi>without reprehenſion: That to</hi> be a Traitor, <hi>which is defin'd, and every man underſtands, ſhould be no crime; and to be</hi> call'd Malignant, <hi>which no body knows the meaning of, ſhould be ground enough for cloſe Impriſonment: That a Law ſhould be made, that whoſoever ſhould preſume to take Tonnage and Poundage, without an Act of Parliament, ſhould incur the penalty of a</hi> Praemunire; <hi>and in the ſame Parliament, that the ſame Impoſition ſhould be laid upon our Subjects, and taken, by an Order of both Houſes, without and againſt our Conſent? Laſtly, That in the ſame Parliament, a Law ſhould be made to declare the proceedings and judgment upon Ship-money to be illegal and void, and during that Parliament, that an Order of both Houſes ſhall, upon pretence of Neceſſity, enable four men to take away from all their Neighbours the Twentieth part of their

Eſtates, according to their diſcretion?</hi> Thus his Majeſty. And yet theſe are the men whom a Prince or State ſhall know where to find. I might inſtance in more particulars of the ſame or worſe complexion, as to <hi>Lay-Presbyterians;</hi> but I muſt not paſs over in ſilence ſome of the <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters of London,</hi> to whom <hi>Price</hi> in his <hi>Clerico-Claſſ.</hi> p. 53. ſpeaks thus: <hi>If doubts ariſe concerning reſiſting Kings and Rulers, especially in caſe of Oaths, Vows or Covenants, touching preſervation of the perſon of the King, (as there did from the Solemn League and Covenant) then you are ready to give ſatisfaction, and to tell the people, that that clauſe in the Covenant is to be underſtood not ſimply, but relatively, that is, is not a ſingle, but a complex engagement, not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, but a conditional clauſe (with many ſuch diſtinctions.) It is for the Kings perſon in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Religion and Liberties; and though the King ſhould be deſtroyed by you, you have notwithſtanding kept your Covenant.

I meet with this ſtory touching one Mr. <hi>Edmond Calamy</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermanbury London: That in the times when the Biſhops did bear rule he obeyed their Laws, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Injunctions, Orders and Ceremonies, (we ſay not wearing the Surplice, reading the Service-Book, and Croſſing in Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which many honeſt and Godly Miniſters in thoſe dark days did likewiſe perform, but) reading the ſecond Service at the High Altar, preaching in a Surplice and Tippet, bowing at the Name of Jeſus, and ſo zealous an obſerver of times and ſeaſons, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick and weak upon Chriſtmaſs Day, yet with much difficulty he got into the Pulpit, declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there to this purpoſe, that he thought himſelf bound in conſcience to ſtrive to preach on that day, leſt the ſtones in the ſtreet ſhould riſe up againſt him: And yet upon the wonderful turn of the times, Ejection of Epiſcopacy and advance of Presbytery, did preſently and without delay not only aſſert the ſame, but inſtructed the people in Presbyterian Principles after ſuch a rate of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and skill, as if his Education had been</hi> ſome Superintendent among the Presbyterian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Reformed Churches beyond Sea, <hi>and not</hi> ſuch a notorious conformitant unto and notable ſtickler for the Prelates Fooleries (as the Author of that Pamphlet is pleaſed to ſpeak) <hi>in the County of</hi> Suffolk, <hi>in the Kingdome of</hi> England.

               <hi>p. 7. That as the Conſtitution of publick Affairs varies among us, ſo the conſtitutions of theſe mens Sermons do alter and change; one while we find them all for moderation and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an accommodation, and forbearance one of another; another while all for Reformation again, that is, Presbytery in the rigid ſence thereof, that is, that all power may be in the Miniſters hands, and the Magiſtrates engaged to put their Orders, and Edicts, wills and pleaſures into execution; one while pleading for and preſſing the ſetting up the Government of Chriſt in the hearts of men, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be zealous for the great things of the Goſpel, Faith, Repentance, and love among Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and not to contend ſo ſtrenuouſly for the Mint and Cummin, Diſcipline and Government,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anotherwhile calling with might and main for Reformation, Reformation, putting the Crown upon the Head of Chriſt, and the Scepter into his hand, pleading for the Government of Jeſus Chriſt, that is, the exalting themſelves above their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> and yet <hi>theſe are the men ſo fixt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as none more.</hi> The truth is, theſe and other Teſtimonies which might be produced, do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly evince that Presbyterian Principles alter according to the variation of the Presbyterian Intereſt. And that the ſame Principles which men of that temper exclaim againſt and condemn, when made uſe of to the prejudice of their Party, or in defence of Prelatical Government, have notwithſtanding been approved of, and reduced into practice by them, when the doing ſo tended
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51388:85"/>
to the promotion and advancement of their Intereſt. Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> hath long ſince mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the world by the ſeveral inſtances pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in his <hi>Survey of the pretended Holy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, c. 26. There is nothing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>more uſually objected againſt the</hi> preſent State, Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and Authority of Biſhops, <hi>than that of S.</hi> Peter, 1. Pet. 5. <hi>Not as though you were Lords over the Clergy. And</hi> Luk. 22. 26. <hi>But you ſhall not be ſo. And 'twill not be admitted in any wiſe that we ſhould expound thoſe places of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious affectation, of Tyrannous practice, or of the abuſe of ſuch ſuperiority, or Juriſdiction: But if you will ſpeak of</hi> the Right, Authority, and Juriſdiction of their Elderſhips, <hi>the caſe is altered. There are ſome as it ſeemeth beyond the Seas, who ſeeing the Pride of the Conſiſtorian Government do affirm that the Power of the Church is only Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and not any External Exerciſe, Practice, and right of any Authority, Power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: With this oppoſition ſo much derogating from the dignity of their Elderſhips,</hi> Danaeus <hi>is moved and anſwering that conceit, ſaith, that although the power of the Church</hi> ad animarum ſalutem ſit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parata, <hi>be inſtituted for the health of Souls, yet notwithſtanding it hath neceſſarily annext unto it, an indiſſoluble band, an external exerciſe, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and uſe,</hi> Juris &amp; Gubernationis, <hi>of Law and Government,</hi> De Poteſt. Eccleſ. c. 3. <hi>Againſt this anſwer reply as it ſeemeth is made with the ſame places mentioned that are urged againſt our Biſhops; whereupon</hi> Danaeus <hi>to make all things
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51388:85"/>
clear, adds theſe words to his former Anſwer and publiſhes the ſame from</hi> Geneva [<hi>whereas it may be objected out of Peter, Not bearing Rule,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>'Tis eaſily anſwered,</hi> Damnatur enim partim abuſus, non uſus illius poteſtatis; partim illius cum civili confuſio; <hi>for partly the abuſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, not the uſe of that power, and partly the confounding of it with the civil power.] Which is the very anſwer that we make and approve (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extorted from them by Gods good providence) for the ſtopping of our mens mouths, who upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of thoſe places, have opened them ſo wide againſt the lawful authority of our Biſhops.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther example of the like nature we have in the ſame Chapter: <hi>It is a thing too manifeſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with what libelling and railing the Form of our Service, of our Ceremonies, of our Ornaments, of our Apparel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath been depraved and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſlandered; as that our Communion Book was culied out of the Popes Portuiſe—this was abuſed in Popery—that is papiſtical.—What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever cometh from the Pope comes firſt from the Devil.—If of the Eggs of a Cockatrice can be made wholſome meat to feed with—then may alſo the things that come from the Pope and the Devil be good, profitable and neceſſary to the Church. Againſt theſe ſpeeches anſwer hath been made, that 'tis lawful to try all things and to hold faſt that which is good; that we muſt diſtinguiſh between the abuſe of a thing and its lawful uſe.—that as good men ſometimes deviſe that which is Evil, ſo Evil men may ſometimes deviſe that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51388:86"/>
which is profitable: But all theſe anſwers are miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, denied and condemned by theſe our Factioners. Howbeit upon occaſion the ſtream is turned, and they themſelves are driven to make the very ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers for the juſtifying of their own proceedings, and for the maintenance of certain particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they do urge and allow of. It hath been laid to their charge, that for all their goodly pretences of Reformation, yet indeed the courſe they held did ſmell moſt rankly of Anabaptiſm, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and of a new kind of Papiſm; as where they diſquiet the peace of the Churches already reformed, rail upon our Miniſters and their Calling, affirm that our Sacraments are not ſincerely miniſtred; that there is no Church as it ſhould be but thoſe that they like of; that our Ceremonies and Orders are all unlawful; that we have no lawful Miniſters or Biſhops;—that Princes may not deal in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe and many ſuch like points being laid to their charge,</hi> Cartwright (<hi>as though he had never dream'd of any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) frames this general anſwer in the name of all his fraternity.</hi> (T. C. B. 2. Ep.) <hi>If among the filth of their Hereſies</hi> (viz. <hi>of Papiſts, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and Donatiſts,) there may be found any good thing (as it were a grain of good Corn in a great deal of darnel) that we willingly receive not as theirs, but as the Jews did the holy Ark from the Philiſtines, whereof they were unjuſt owners: For herein 'tis true that is ſaid, the Sheep muſt not lay down her fell, becauſe ſhe ſees the Wolf ſometimes clothed with it; yea it may come
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51388:86"/>
to paſs that the Synagogue of Satan may have ſome one thing at ſome time with more convenience than the true and Catholick Church of Chriſt: Such was the Ceremony of pouring Water once only upon the Child in Baptiſm uſed with us and in the moſt reformed Churches, which in ſome Ages was uſed by thoſe of the Eunomian Hereſy.</hi>] Much more of the ſame ſtrain is legible in that chapter touching the mutability of <hi>the ancient Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> when the changing of their Opinions would render their Intereſt more conſiderable. And is there no example think you, to be met with of the like mutability in <hi>our Modern Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians?</hi> Judge by what follows whether they have not contradicted their own Principles, yea and thoſe of their Presbyterian Anceſtors. For the proof of the latter, I refer the Reader to a little Book called, [<hi>Beams of former Light</hi>] written (by Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> as 'tis reported) on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that Ordinance made by the Secluded Members at their Re-admiſſion into the Houſe of Commons (1660.) impoſing on all Miniſters the Aſſemblie's leſſer Catechiſm under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of their being ejected as ſcandalous <hi>p.</hi> 101. if they neglected to uſe it though but 10 Sundays in a year (unleſs on a cauſe approved of by two Juſtices) againſt which impoſitions thoſe Beams of Light, (diſcovering how evil 'tis to impoſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diſputable Forms on Miniſters under penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Ejection) were darted. In which Book the Author heaps up the Arguments of the <hi>old Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Nonconformiſts</hi> againſt <hi>the new ones, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51388:87"/>
that injunction of theirs,</hi> and endeavours to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it <hi>more harſh and ſevere than the former Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Impoſitions (p. 104, 105. 77.) and yet that there was more reaſon and neceſſity for thoſe than this, p.</hi> 107. he throngs together the ſame Scripture-proofs againſt this, that were formerly urged againſt thoſe, and ſpeaks as ſuperſtitiouſly againſt a Catechiſm-Book, <hi>p.</hi> 37, 38. as the men of the Presbyterian ſtrain were wont to ſpeak againſt a Prayer-Book, and an Homily-Book. From which diſcourſe it appears that thoſe men did for the advancement of their Intereſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Principles [<hi>of their Nonconforming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.</hi>] And that they have upon the ſame ſcore contradicted <hi>their own Principles,</hi> I ſhall evidence partly from this <hi>John Corbet</hi>'s affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning them, partly from their late Book called [<hi>The Covenanters Plea againſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvers.</hi>] In which laſt piece I obſerve that though they did not well underſtand, <hi>p.</hi> 6. what good thing can be aſſigned which falls under no divine Precept, (and conſequently they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how any good thing can be indifferent and uncommanded) yet <hi>p.</hi> 10. they grant <hi>that the matter of a Promiſe, Vow, Oath or Covenant, may be ſomething (not neceſſary or previouſly required of us by ſome divine Law, but) free and indifferent, not determined by the divine Law;</hi> And <hi>that rational and religious Acts</hi> (for ſuch they affirm Oaths, Vows and Covenants to be (Ch. 2. Sect. 3.—Ch. 3. <hi>p.</hi> 11.) yea ſacred Invocations of the name of God, preces of divine

S. 19. and that the obligation of an Oath thus impoſed reſults from Divine Inſtitution,</hi> p. 62. S. 11. <hi>from God's Law,</hi> p. 64. Sect. 13. By which Conceſſions they do not only condemn all thoſe Nonconformiſts, who refuſed compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Epiſcopal Impoſitions, becauſe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) their Chriſtian Liberty in things left indifferent by God, ought not to be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced and reſtrained by man; but alſo they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, 1. that principle, <hi>That nothing is a duty, eſpecially in Gods worſhip, which is not commanded by God;</hi> and 2. that principle, that <hi>no part of worſhip is lawful which is not commanded of God;</hi> and yet both theſe principles are owned by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, if this Author deceive us not, <hi>p.</hi> 88. 98. where he tells us they hold, that <hi>Scripture only is the Rule of inſtituted worſhip, wherein both additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diminution is alike forbidden;</hi> and p. 84, 85. that <hi>whatſoever inſtituted worſhip is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God is unlawful;</hi> whence it ſollows, that men ought not to ſwear or Covenant for or againſt any thing that's left indifferent in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law; not for any thing which God's word commands not, nor againſt any thing which it does not forbid. For ſo to do is to worſhip God, by taking ſuch an Oath, and entring into
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51388:88"/>
ſuch a Covenant as is not ordained by him, but is only of humane Inſtitution and determination. Now the Solemn League and Covenant was not either inſtituted or impoſed by God in his Law, either of Nature or Scripture, (even by their own confeſſion, who on Saturday <hi>Aug.</hi> 5. 1648. affirmed in the Houſe of Commons, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it ſelf was not <hi>jure Divino,</hi> though the keeping of it being taken was, <hi>Hiſt. of Independ. 1 Part p.</hi> 125, 126.) but only by men; and 'tis acknowledged by thoſe pleaders to have been a Vow only (freely and voluntarily entred into, and not by vertue of any Divine command) in the firſt takers and impoſers; and therefore (ſince 'tis owned alſo as a ſacred, religious Act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) 'twas in them and others, not only a piece of Schiſm againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of Sedition againſt the King and Laws of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo a ſolemn piece of ſuperſtition &amp; will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (as that ſignifies, in their own dialect, a worſhipping God in ſuch a manner as himſelf hath not preſcribed in his Word,) and therefore (on the ſcore of Presbyterian principles) an Act of high and hainous diſobedience to the Law of God; and therefore their taking an Oath thus impoſed, was to violate their principles for the advancement of their Intereſt: and yet theſe are the men that are ſo fixt and conſtant as none more. Beſides, this Author tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 85. that <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians hold, that that Ceremony which is inſtituted by men,</hi> (not by God) <hi>which is of myſtical ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and (though it may naturally, yet) <hi>does
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51388:88"/>
not actually ſignifie without humane inſtitution, and is by men appropriate to Divine worſhip, is (upon that account) a part of Divine worſhip:</hi> and p. 88. 98. they hold, that <hi>all ſuch ſacred Ceremonies (not commanded by God) are neither good nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> But ſay I, this was the very caſe in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Covenant; for the Ceremony with which the Covenanters did take it, <hi>viz.</hi> lifting up the hand, was <hi>appropriate to that Oath,</hi> (which they deemed a piece of religious worſhip.) It did <hi>not actually ſignifie</hi> that the Takers did ſwear, either by Divine, or Natural, but by Humane Inſtitution, and that novel too: the uſual Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of taking an Oath in this Nation, (before) being <hi>tactis ſacroſanctis Chriſti Evangeliis,</hi> laying the hand upon, and afterwards kiſſing the holy Evangels; to which indeed that Covenant was ſo contrary, that 'tis no wonder the Covenant was ſo contrary, that 'tis no wonder the Ceremony was altered and exchanged for that of lifting up the hand, which is not of Divine Inſtitution, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by God the Father in the Old Teſtament, and much leſs by God the Son in the New, whom yet Presbyterians hold <hi>to be the only Maſter of ordaining Ceremonies for the Chriſtian Worſhip;</hi> and ſome of them, it ſeems, are <hi>yet to learn, that any examples oblige them, but thoſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,</hi> (and conſequently no Old Teſtament examples,) Diſcourſe of Liturgies, <hi>p.</hi> 60. And that that Ceremony was of myſtical ſignification I prove by that <hi>medium</hi> which this Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf makes uſe of, <hi>p.</hi> 87. 97. to prove the Croſs in Baptiſm ſuch a Ceremony, <hi>viz. It is uſed as a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51388:89"/>
ſealing ſign of our obligation to Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's in that reſpect Sacramental:</hi> ſo ſay I was the lifting up of the hand (in the ſwearing the Covenant) uſed as a ſealing ſign of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters obligation to God and Chriſt—Although indeed and in truth by that Covenant ſealed with that Ceremony they dedicated themſelves to the diſſervice of him that died on the Croſs, to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and practical defiance of Chriſt the King of his Church, and his Vicegerent in this Nation, King <hi>Charles.</hi> Thus a Ceremony of humane (Presbyterian) inſtitution for the ratification of a ſeditious Covenant, ordained and impoſed againſt Law by an illegal power, for the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Scotch</hi> appetite, and promoting the Presbyterian Intereſt, is a Camel eaſily and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſwallowed by the capacious throat of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Covenanter, who yet at the ſame time can either blindly or perverſly ſtrain at the Gnat of a Ceremony inſtituted by lawful Authority, eſtabliſht and enjoyned by the Laws of the Land and Conſtitutions of the Church. If I had ſome Books about me (fit for ſuch a purpoſe) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I could add ſome ſheets of pertinent inſtances (to Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi>'s Collection in that 26. <hi>ch.</hi> of his Survey) of Presbyterian Levity in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inconſiſtency with themſelves, and with others of their own Faction, when ſelf-intereſt prompted them to ſuch variations. I ſhall at this time mention only one proof more. 'Tis a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated principle of the Covenanters in their Plea, and their diſcourſe of Liturgies, that <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51388:89"/>
the Parliament nor any power under Heaven, can diſcharge them from the obligation of an Oath.</hi> This is good Doctrine it ſeems, when applied to the Covenant, and underſtood in a ſence advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to Presbytery: but when the Queſtion was about the obligation of the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (wherein they ſwore, that they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors, to the uttermoſt of their power, againſt all conſpiracies and attempts whatſoever, which ſhould be made againſt his or their Perſons, Crown and Dignity, by reaſon or colour of any Sentence or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope, [<hi>or otherwiſe;</hi>] and that they are in conſcience reſolved, that neither the Pope nor any perſon whatſoever hath power to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them of that Oath, or any part of it;) I ſay, when this was the Queſtion, then Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian practiſes maniſeſted, that they accounted the contrary good Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that thoſe two Houſes (who were far enough from either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving or being capable of the Title of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England</hi>) might diſcharge men from the obligation of this Oath; for they impoſed the Negative Oath, and made men ſwear, that they would not directly or indirectly adhere to, or willingly aſſiſt the King in his War againſt the Forces of the two Houſes; which Negative Oath being contrary to that of Allegiance, could not with any colour of reaſon or conſcience be impoſed or taken, unleſs the impoſers and takers were perſwaded of the truth of that principle, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Presbyterian Lords and Commons
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51388:90"/>
had authority to diſcharge men from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Oath; and yet theſe are the men that are ſo fixt and conſtant as none more: and ſo ſetled in their principles, that a Prince or State may know where to find them; words that, for ought I ſee, have no Truth in them at all, unleſs underſtood in this ſence, that a Prince may be ſure to find Presbyterians conſtant <hi>to their ſelf-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> though not <hi>to their Principles,</hi> and fixt and diligent in deſigning methods, and carrying on contrivances in oppoſition to legal eſtabliſhments, for the thruſting up Presbytery into the Throne, and the forcing of Majeſty and Prelacy to embrace a Dunghil.</p>

it may be, ſtep by ſtep, firſt by talking ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in private Conventicles; then by railing and reviling Loyal ſubjects in the Pulpit; then by ſlandering inferiour Governours, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them contemptible and odious unto the people; and afterwards by raiſing jealouſies and envious malicious paſſions in mens minds againſt the Supreme: and if he let the ſword of Juſtice ruſt in the ſcabbard, till by the predominancy of a tumultuous rabble, aided and abetted by ſome ſeditious, malignant ſpirits among the Nobility and Gentry, he's diſenabled from drawing it, either at all, or to any purpoſe; then thoſe pawns and Rooks will ſtrain ſo high, as to give checkmate to Majeſty, and demonſtrate to the world how imprudently thoſe Pearls of Royal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, lenity, and condeſcenſion were caſt before ſuch Swine, whoſe brutiſh temper inclines them to turn upon and rent their Benefactors; like traiterous <hi>Judas</hi>'s, to reward them evil for good, and hatred for their good will.

One Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> being examined upon his Oath, what the laſt words ſhould mean, anſwered, That he himſelf, Mr. <hi>Snape,</hi> Mr. <hi>Proudloe</hi> and others, did agree to put that Diſcipline in execution and practice, <hi>ſo far as the peace and the preſent ſtate of the Church would ſuffer, and not enforce to the contrary, that is, till the Magiſtrate did enjoyn them or enforce them to leave the practice of the ſaid Diſcipline—Now,</hi> ſays the Biſhop, <hi>what if by the ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices (to draw away the peoples hearts from the preſent Government of the Church) they could have procured ſuch ſtrength and number to have followed them, as that no reaſonable reſtraint or force of the Magiſtrate had been able to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered and ſuppreſſed them? I do but ask the Queſtion,</hi> ſays he, <hi>p.</hi> 101. and I anſwer it thus: If they had been of the ſame Rebellious humour with our modern Presbyterians, they would, when they had brought things to that paſs, have appeared in Arms, and raiſed a bloudy War,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51388:91"/>
and by force have ſet up their holy Diſcipline, and ſtrained ſo high in contradiction to all legal Authority, as to have ſubverted the conſtitution of our Engliſh Monarchy, and turned our Government in Church and State Topſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turvy.</p>
            <p>He goes on: [<hi>They can have no pleaſure in commotions, for Order and regular Unity is their Way, and therefore ſtability of Government and publick Tranquillity is their Intereſt:</hi>] Which has ſomething of Truth in it, if underſtood of Presbyterians, when they are got into the Saddle themſelves, and are well ſetled in an uſurp'd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, but till then (for ought I ſee) they take as much pleaſure in commotions and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Jeſuits do, and will diſturb the publick Tranquillity, and ſubvert all legal Order and regular Unity, rather than ſuffer their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to be rejected and depreſſed; witneſs their late Wars, and their Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and a ſeries of other actions, whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency was to the deſtruction of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Polity, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, as is before manifeſted.</p>
            <p>[<hi>It's moſt unreaſonable,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to object that the late wild poſtures, extravagancies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities in Government were the work of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery or Presbyterians;</hi> his reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the Nation had never proof of Presbytery, for 'twas never ſettled.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If it ſhould be granted that the Nation had never proof of Presbytery, what's this to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51388:92"/>
Presbyterians (whom the objection ſpeaks of as well as Presbytery?) Had the Nation never any proof of ſuch kind of Creatures? nay had we not ſuch proof of them for ſeveral years together, as we have great reaſon to lament even to this day? And I much fear that the ſatal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of thoſe wild poſtures and extravagancies which Presbyterians, (ſuch perſons as himſelf deſcribed, <hi>p.</hi> 20. 30. by their main and rooted Principles) were the Authors of, is not yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; but will work us more miſchief, and be very prejudicial to thoſe initials of Order and Tranquillity, which at preſent we (through mercy) enjoy.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51388:92"/>
alſo men of quick apprehenſions) they ſpeedily and throughly learnt the Presbyterian Arts of dividing and diſſipating; yea thoſe Factious Scholars made ſuch zealous, diligent, and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Improvements of thoſe Factious Principles which the great Presbyterian Faction had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated into them both by Doctrine and Practice, that they became two-fold more the children of Hell than their Teachers, and ſo extravagant and unruly at laſt as to whip their great Maſter out of that ſeditious and Tyrannical School with Rods of his own making, and to rout Presbytery in the ſtrength of thoſe very principles by which [Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians] had before routed Prelacy firſt and then Majeſty.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Neither,</hi> ſays he, <hi>can Sects or Schiſms with any Truth or Juſtice be reckoned the Off-ſpring of Presbytery</hi>] If he mean by Presbytery [exact Presbytery] (<hi>p.</hi> 44. 54.) and that Scotch Form of Eccleſiaſtical Polity (59. 69.) where there is no preſiding Biſhop, he contradicts Father <hi>Hierome,</hi> who (though Presbyterians account him their great Friend) teſtifies in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that Epiſcopacy was inſtituted (<hi>unus caeteri praepoſitus—ſuperpoſitus</hi>—) for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Schiſms which were begotten by Presbytery: <hi>In Schiſmatis remedium factum eſt, nè unuſquiſque ad ſe trahens Chriſti Eccleſiam rumperit,</hi> (Ep. ad Evagrium.) <hi>ut Schiſmatum ſemina tolerentur.</hi>—and thoſe <hi>studia in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione</hi> which happened when the Churches were governed <hi>communi Presbyterorum conſilio,</hi> (in

Theſe courſes are eſteemed good and laudable in <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and may be called <hi>Healing,</hi> when made uſe of by Presbyterians: but if our Biſhops and their presbyters ſhould deal thus with the diſobedient presbyterians here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Excommunication would be called <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> and the impoſing of Canonical ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>a yoke of bondage,</hi> an <hi>unneaſonable thing,</hi> and what not?

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51388:96"/>
confeſs, that <hi>that Declaration cannot diſſolve the obligation of a Law,</hi>) would not have that yoke laid on mens necks any more; ſince 'tis in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>both unneceſſary, unprofitable; and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi> which laſt he proves againſt Prelatiſts by as weak an Argument as <hi>White</hi> (as 'tis ſuſpected) brings, in the latter end of <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>'s firſt Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, to prove (againſt proteſtants in general) that 'tis unreaſonable for them to hold any point certainly true, and conſequently to require any ſubſcription to Articles, <hi>viz. becauſe they profeſs themſelves fallible;</hi> as if they who confeſs they might have been deceived, may not yet be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (upon good grounds) that they are not actually deceived; and upon that account re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſubſcription to them. The other two he proves alſo by ſuch Arguments as will render all Synods, Presbyterian as well as Epiſcopal, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs things; and which will prove the <hi>Dutch, French</hi> or <hi>Scotch</hi> impoſition of Articles, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons as unneceſſary, unprofitable, and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and yet Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us in his Survey, <hi>p.</hi> 311. that <hi>if the beſt and the learnedſt man in Chriſtendom were in</hi> Geneva, <hi>and ſhould oppoſe himſelf to any thing that the Church there holdeth, if he eſcaped with his life he might thank God, but he ſhould be ſure not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Miniſter there—No man ſhall ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me,</hi> ſays the Biſhop, <hi>but that the word of God doth give as free liberty to the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>for the repreſſing of ſuch Schiſmaticks, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to</hi> Geneva <hi>or any Church whatſoever:</hi> Thus
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51388:96"/>
he. And if Prelatiſts had been as diligent and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in enquiring out, and puniſhing; diſſenters from the publickly receiv'd Doctrine, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners of the Laws of our Church, a greater unity might have been procured, and our ſad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and breaches, in all likelihood, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: I mean, on ſuppoſition that the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates had in their ſeveral places reſpectively, firmly adhered to the Eccleſiaſtical, and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Canonical Cenſures, if contemn'd, with the addition of Civil penalties upon the refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and contumacious: without which 'tis not probable that the <hi>Dort</hi> Aſſembly would have proved an [Healing Synod,] nor the <hi>Scotch</hi>-Diſcipline a ſufficient preſervative againſt Sects and Schiſms: which I am apt enough to believe ſeverity will ſuppreſs, though exerciſed by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, if the Civil Governours act their part in abetting and promoting the juſt ſeverity of Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Whence therefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>p. 60. ſhould this charge of Presbyteries begetting Sects and Schiſms ariſe? Peradventure ſome Presbyterians have turned Sectaries.

            <p>A. I acknowledge that arguing weak; but what if they that make the objection be found to frame their Argument (in reference to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Presbyterians) in this manner? Multitudes that embraced thoſe Principles, which Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51388:97"/>
owned in the days of their calamity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, turned Sectaries and Schiſmaticks after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and yet ſtill retained thoſe Principles, and by rational deductions pleaded them, in order to the juſtification of their Schiſm; therefore thoſe principles do in their own nature produce Sects and Schiſms. If the caſe be indeed thus, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is ſtrong; and for the proof of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Antecedent, I'le undertake, if this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhall deny either, or evince that the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may, upon the like ground, be urged againſt the Engliſh prelacy.

It ſeems he thinks Tyrannical domineering over Inferiors to be a greater crime than diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and rebellion againſt Superiors, or elſe he would have accounted their being repreſented <hi>as Rebels,</hi> a greater prejudice againſt presbyterians, than their being repreſented as <hi>domineering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi> but he Apologizes for them, by retorting the charge on Prelatiſts, and telling us, that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery is not more ſevere in cenſuring the breach of God's Commandments, than the Hierarchy in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the breach of their own Conſtitutions,</hi> which paſſage looks as if the man had a mind to inſinuate, that Presbyterian ſeverity is exerciſed only on the Tranſgreſſors of God's Commands, and Hierarchical ſeverity only on the offenders againſt Epiſcopal Conſtitutions. Whether he had ſuch an ugly meaning in thoſe words or no, I am not certain, though to him that conſiders the egregious partiality of this diſcourſe hitherto in favour of Presbyterians, 'twill be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he had. If he had (leaving him to prove the truth of them as to the Hierarchy,) I ſhall by and by make bold to diſprove them as to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we'le paſs on to the next words. [<hi>Or is the offence taken upon pretence,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51388:99"/>
that Presbyterians affect and arrogate an arbitrary power, would rule by Faction, and exerciſe a rigour to the ſtirring up of animoſities and unquiet hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours?</hi>]</p>
            <p>A. No; the offence is not taken upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as that's contradiſtinct to proof, but upon ſufficient evidence, that they are arrogant, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious perſons, and very prone to ſtir up and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unquiet humours by their diſciplinarian ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; and though the Nation generally hath not (through the mercy of Divine over-ruling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence) experimented that diſcipline, yet they ſay the <hi>Londoners</hi> had ſuch proof of it in a little time, as made them quite weary of <hi>Claſſical-lay-Elder-Tyranny.</hi> If the goodneſs of an Almighty power had not prevented it, we may well ſuppoſe that Presbytery would have proved as imperious and domineering here in <hi>England,</hi> as Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> tells us, it was in <hi>Scotland. Towards particular perſons,</hi> ſays he, (Fair warning, chap. 11.) <hi>this Diſcipline is too full of rigour, like</hi> Draco'<hi>s Laws, that were written in Bloud; in leſſer faults inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church-cenſures upon ſlight grounds, as for an uncomely geſture, for avain word, for ſuſpicion of covetouſneſs or pride, for ſuperfluity in raiment, either for coſt or faſhion; for dancing at a wedding, or of ſervants in the streets; for wearing a man's hair</hi> a la mode—<hi>for uſing the leaſt recreation on the Sabbath, though void of ſcandal, and conſiſtent with the duties of the Day.—What digladiations have there been among ſome of their Sect about Starch and Cuffs? &amp;c. juſt like thoſe grave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51388:99"/>
which were ſometimes among the</hi> Franciſcans, <hi>about the colour and faſhion of their Gowns; they do not allow men a latitude of diſcretion in any thing. All men, even their Superiors, muſt be their Slaves or Pupils. It's true, they begin their cenſures with admonition; and if a man will confeſs himſelf a Delinquent, be ſorry for giving the Presbyters any offence, and conform himſelf in his hair, apparel, diet, every thing, to what theſe rough-hewn</hi> Cato'<hi>s ſhall preſcribe, he may eſcape the Stool of Repentance, otherwiſe they will proceed againſt him for contumacy to excommunication.</hi> By this let the Reader judge, whether Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians cenſure <hi>the breach of God's Commandments only;</hi> nay, whether they are not more ſevere than Prelacy, in cenſuring <hi>the breach of their own Conſtitutions.</hi> Where has God commanded men to abſtain from dancing? and yet Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> (in his Survey, <hi>c.</hi> 26.) informs us, that <hi>Mr.</hi> Calvin <hi>hearing of that horrible ſin (forſooth) committed by certain perſons at Widow</hi> Balthaſar'<hi>s houſe in</hi> Geneva, <hi>procured them all, both dancers and beholders, to be called before him and his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Conſiſtory.

Add to this the ſeverity and extreme rigour of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication: after which ſentence no perſon (his Wife and Family only excepted) may have any kind of converſation with him that's Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated: They may not eat, nor drink, nor buy, nor ſell with him: They may not ſalute him, nor speak to him, except by the licence of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery: His children begotten and born after that ſentence, and before his reconciliation to the Church,

in every Pariſh, and groan under the arbitrary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of ignorant, unexperienced Governours; who know no Law but their own wills; who obſerve no Order but what they liſt; from whom lies no appeal but to a Synod, which for the ſhortneſs of its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance can afford, which for the condition of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will afford them little relief:</hi> Thus he. Whence 'tis evident enough that they who live under Scotch-Presbyterian-Diſcipline, (and that Diſcipline the Engliſh Covenanters ſwore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the Introduction and advancement of in this Nation; which it concerns us frequently to call to mind, that ſo the ſignal mercy manifeſted in blaſting thoſe endeavours may be the more magnified) muſt like <hi>Iſſachar</hi> crouch under a grievous burden, and either ſubmit their Necks to ſuch heavy yokes as imperious arrogance ſhall affect to lay upon them, or elſe reſolutely ſhake off thoſe yokes, by giving vent to thoſe animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and unquiet humours which will be ſtirred up in them by Presbyterian rigour: as the Scotch Shoomakers did who were moſt intereſſed in the Munday Markets at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which were upon a time aboliſht by a Kirk-Enactment, but they by their tumults and threatnings compelled the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to retract, whereupon it became a Jeſt in the City, that <hi>the Souters could obtain more at the Miniſters hands than the King.</hi> (Fair warning, Ch. 7.)</p>
            <p>But <hi>there are remedies at hand,</hi> ſays our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>to prevent the Abuſe of any Government that is of it ſelf lawful and laudable. Certainly the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51388:101"/>
wiſdom of the King and Parliament, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of grave Divines, may preſcribe ſure and certain Rules of Diſcipline.] A.</hi> Very true, But if I am not miſtaken, Presbyterians have a faculty of controlling and diſobeying the moſt certain Rules and commands of their Governours if not ſuitable to their own fancies and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> tells us in his 7. Chap. <hi>that the Kirk in</hi> Scotland <hi>aſſume a power to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and invalidate Laws and Acts of Parliament, if they ſeem diſadvantagious to the Church. Church Aſſemblies</hi> (ſays one of their Books of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline) <hi>have power to abrogate and aboliſh all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Ordinances concerning Eccleſiaſtical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are found noyſome and unprofitable, and agree not with the times, or are abuſed by the people. The Acts of Parliament 1584. at the very ſame time that they were proclaimed, were proteſted againſt at the Market Croſs of</hi> Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh <hi>by the Miniſters in the name of the Kirk of</hi> Scotland. <hi>The general Aſſembly of</hi> Glaſcow 1638. <hi>impugned Epiſcopacy, and</hi> Perth <hi>Articles although ratified by Acts of Parliament and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws then unrepealed.</hi> And if Presbytery ſhould chance to be eſtabliſhed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by a Law, what ſhall aſſure us that Engliſh presbyterians alſo would not prove unruly and diſobedient Subjects againſt both King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that ſhall preſcribe any Rule to them in order to the preventing of their arrogant Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny? Not their Oaths, unleſs they had kept thoſe of Supremacy, Allegiance, and Canonical
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51388:102"/>
obedience better. But this Author has another remedy.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Moreover,</hi> quoth he, <hi>to cut off all occaſions and prevent all appearance of domineering, all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical coercive juriſdiction in matters of Religion may be withheld (if need require) from Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Perſons, and that meer ſpiritual power alone</hi> (by which he means Admonition and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication) <hi>may be left to their manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>] The man ſure would perſwade us that (he thinks) there can be no occaſion of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering afforded by the granting, nor appearance of it in the exerciſe of <hi>power meerly ſpiritual,</hi> and then there is ſome hopes that he is not in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who imagine that the Prelates here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore did Tyrannically abuſe that power. But for all this he is unwilling that Presbyterians ſhould have <hi>only ſpiritual power</hi> at their command, and be wholly deveſted of <hi>political,</hi> and therefore what he takes away with one hand, he gives with the other in the following words.</p>
            <p>[<hi>And becauſe ſpiritual cenſures appertaining only to the Conſcience may be too little regarded when no temporal damage is annext unto them, there may be a collateral, civil power always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Eccleſiaſtical meetings, to take cognizance of all cauſes therein debated and adjudged in order to temporal penalties.</hi>] From which words we may gather, 1. That the man is loth that all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of domineering ſhould be cut off from Presbyterians, and all appearance of it prevented. 2. That he can well enough digeſt prelatical
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51388:102"/>
power, and as many Eccleſiaſtical Courts in a County as there are Eccleſiaſtical meetings, if ſo be Presbyterian Prieſts and Lay-Elders may have the management of that power and ſit as Judges in thoſe Courts; which is another indication that ambitious affections (rather than an impartial judgment) make presbyterians exclaim ſo much againſt Prelacy; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to exerciſe that dominion themſelves which they condemn in others as Tyrannical.</p>
            <p>[<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the whole matter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>aforegoing we firmly build this poſition, That the Presbyterian Party ought not in Juſtice or Reaſon of State to be rejected and depreſſed, but ought to be protected and encouraged.</hi>]</p>
            <p>And upon the anſwer to that matter contained in theſe Papers, I firmly build this contradictory Poſition, That the Presbyterian Party ought not in Juſtice or Reaſon of State to be protected and (much leſs) encouraged, but to be rejected and depreſſed; <hi>unleſs they will renounce the practiſes and principles here objected and laid to their charge; and will diſclaim that Covenant, which otherwiſe will engage them in ſuch turbulent and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious practices, as can never be juſtified but by ſuch rebellious Principles.</hi>
